While one right decision can make the business to reach the sky, one wrong decision can bring down the business. With the increasing competition of IT industries, the investments, business directives and the business data are increasing exponentially. Hence, the business owner should be extra cautious and must keep all the factors in mind while decision making. Thus, demanding a great requirement of a tool which measures and monitors the growth of the business and to evidence that the business is heading towards the profitable direction. Even though there are few existing methods to measure the growth of the company, these are limited to provide basic information or have restrictions in analyzing the behavior of the business. Therefore, fail to provide the complete assurance to business owners in decision making. This work provides an efficient Nobel solution to address these problems by focusing on developing a Performance Dashboard. The proposed technique involves an integration of business intelligence technologies, data mining and data visualization technologies creating a perfect solution to analyze the business trends, business growth, the amount of profit, employee performance, customer satisfaction, areas of improvements in business and much more. This performance dashboard showcases the information by understating the business behavior right from the organization start period. It acts as an information management tool that is used to track the metrics, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and additional key factors applicable to the business or specific process. Using data visualization techniques, dashboard simplifies the complex data sets to deliver users with a glancing awareness of present performance and to keep track on the department's capability to accomplish service level targets.","","978-1-5386-0569-1978-1-5386-0568-4978-1-5386-0570","10.1109/SmartTechCon.2017.8358558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358558","Performance Dashboard;KPI;Data Visualization;Business analytics;Business Intelligence;REST web services;Single Sign On;SAML;Pentaho;Bootstrap;REST frame work;MVC;RBAC","Data visualization;Data mining;Measurement;Business intelligence;Companies","business data processing;competitive intelligence;customer satisfaction;data mining;data visualisation;decision making;information management;personnel","complex data sets;data visualization techniques;Key Performance Indicators;information management tool;business behavior;employee performance;business growth;business trends;data visualization technologies;data mining;business intelligence technologies;profitable direction;decision making;business owner;business data;business directives;wrong decision;executive decisions;performance dashboard","","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This experiment was aimed to study the effect of three communication tasks on driver's behavior: listening to the radio, discussing with a passenger and holding a hands-free phone conversation. Performance was assessed through reaction time (RT) to visual stimuli when driving on a private closed circuit. Drivers were requested to leave their foot from the accelerator pedal when orange lights, placed on the dashboard, switched on. This stimulus was triggered while subjects performed both driving and one of the three additional tasks. Skin resistance level (SRL) and instantaneous heart rate (IHR) were continuously recorded as indices of arousal. Rest and driving were taken as reference. Phoning while driving elicited the highest RT. SRL showed 3 levels of arousal, from the lowest to the highest: rest, driving and the dual task condition (driving + communication). Thus, arousal remained constant whatever the additional task although IHR showed that arousal was higher when phoning than when listening to the radio.

"Customer Scenario Focused End-to-End Testing","C. Liang; A. Malatpure; M. Shafiei; M. Vago; T. Zheng","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","","2012","","","80","81","End to end testing is critical for ensuring the quality of a software product. Popular software products are deployed by customers in a wide variety of configurations over a broad range of hardware. Testing efforts, being subject to normal business constraints (limited time and resources) do not find it possible to recreate all customer scenarios in-house. In such a situation, it is valuable to understand how to model a wide range of customer scenarios so that their shared elements and unique traits can be distinguished from each other. Given such a modeling approach, it is necessary to know how to build a testing infrastructure that can utilize traditional functional tests, but reorient them in a way that provides high customer scenario coverage at optimal cost. In this paper, we model customer scenarios from the perspective of the services they enable. Services typically have multiple categories of users, with each category expecting the service to provide functionality catering to its unique requirements. This setup is modeled in our approach by using the 'Persona -- Experience - Usecase' hierarchy. Persona refers to the different categories of users that utilize a service. Experience refers to the user experiences that each user category expects from the service. Usecases clarify the specific requirements of the distinct functionality expected by each user category. Using such a persona-experience-usecase hierarchy to model customer scenarios helps demarcate requirements common to multiple scenarios from those that are specific to certain deployments. We create the scenario test model to test the corresponding experiences and usecases for different personas. The test model consists of topologies and schemas. A test topology helps capture the uniqueness associated with each scenario. It is further split into 2 parts viz. roles (that capture the various software settings associated with the customer scenario) and configurations (that capture the hardware setup, a.k.a. machine-network-storage combination associated with the customer scenario). A test schema captures the test activities related to the customer scenarios. It consists of 'action groups', with each action group being associated with a usecase for the customer scenario. Thus the 'Persona - Experience - Usecase' hierarchy in customer scenario modeling broadly corresponds to the 'Test Scenario - Topology, TestSchema - Roles, Configurations, Action Groups' hierarchy in the test object model. Multi-functional, service oriented customer scenarios require that core experiences associated with each persona continue to be met during the different states of the service. We have used the concept of 'Service Level Agreements (SLAs)' to capture such core experiences to validate their continued satisfaction. Most real-world customer deployments are susceptible to hardware and software faults. We have explicitly added faults (both hardware and software) to our object model to test service resiliency under such conditions. In a customer scenario, SLAs and faults are typically associated with usecases. We have used a similar association in the test object model to compose action groups from 3 sources viz. user actions, faults and user SLAs. We implemented the proposed approach in the development cycle for Windows Server 2012. The implementation manifested as a testing infrastructure with four major components namely: deployment creator, test scheduler, monitoring system and reporting dashboard. A flexible deployment creator configured different test topologies (i.e. fileserver, high availability clustering, networking and storage variations). Action groups consisted of traditional functional tests, specially written SLA tests and simulated hardware, software faults. A smart stochastic scheduler coordinated these action groups and was used to simulate persona-experience patterns. A monitoring system gathered 2 distinct types of information, viz.: action group success status and system health indicators. Finally a rich reporting dashboard was used to overlay this information in a continuous time graph for quality assurance and issue triage. The above testing infrastructure enabled us to find issues that had been missed in traditional functional and stress tests. We targeted multiple customer scenarios and found a good mix of issues spanning different features in the software. These results increase our confidence in this approach and we propose to evolve it further going forward.","","978-1-4673-5048-8978-0-7695-4928","10.1109/ISSREW.2012.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405421","end to end testing;system testing;scenario testing;software testing;customer scenario modeling","Software;Testing;Hardware;Topology;Network topology;Monitoring;Abstracts","program testing;software quality;software reliability","end-to-end testing;software product;persona-experience-usecase hierarchy;scenario test model;action group;test object model;multifunctional customer scenario;service oriented customer scenario;service level agreement;SLA;deployment creator;test scheduler;monitoring system;reporting dashboard;continuous time graph","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our framework creates links between loaded widgets automatically; additional functionalities are thus added automatically to existing widgets as long as the end-user loads other widgets to his personal environment; in the same way as he launches an application on his Windows environment.

Because of its urgencies, it has vulnerabilities and risks that hinder the quality of hospital management. Technological management tools are effective in improving processes and strategic administration because they provide information reliability. The aim of this work is to propose to the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals (FUH's) the use of an open source Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Pentaho, to analyze the Hospital Occupancy Rate (HOR) and support clinical decision making. This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.","","978-9-8998-4347-9978-1-5090-5047","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975882","ICT;hospital management;BI;BHSC;hospital indicators","Hospitals;Business intelligence;Silicon;Data warehouses;Tools;Information and communication technology;Monitoring","data warehouses;decision making;hospitals;medical administrative data processing;relational databases","ICT;operational beds;BHSC hospitals;Brazilian Hospital Services Company;relational database;data warehouse;data extraction;hospital indicator occupancy rate;NASH;National Agency of Supplementary Health;E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation;BI;clinical decision making;HOR;Pentaho;open source business intelligence tool;FUH;hospital management;Brazilian Federal University hospitals;hospital occupation rate analysis","","","","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently the majority of DR resources are based on commercial loads in which substantial amounts of DR resources for residential purposes are wasted. Despite the multiple advantages of demand response to such residential customers, they are often reluctant to participate in such programs because of privacy concerns or because they are unaware of time-based rates. In this study, a customer dashboard was developed to enhance and persuade customers to participate in demand response programs. The online dashboard was used to increase awareness of all customer types, which is essential for ensuring a significant increase of DR participants. Incorporating flexibility, ease-of-use, and rewards programs will attract customers to use the dashboard thus expanding customer awareness to consciously or subconsciously change energy consumption behaviors. Making such cultural changes in customer behaviors leads to a long term solution for participation in demand response programs. With enhanced DR participation a sustainable power system operation and environment can be realized.","","978-1-5386-2699-3978-1-5386-2698-6978-1-5386-2700","10.1109/NAPS.2017.8107300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8107300","customer behavior;demand response management;participation;positive influence;visualization","Load management;Schedules;Pricing;Load flow control;Home appliances;Load modeling;Privacy","demand side management;energy consumption","residential customers;residential purposes;electricity usage;electricity consumers;demand response programs","","","","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, the divergence and frequent changes of different compliance sources make it hard to systematically and quickly accommodate new compliance requirements due to the lack of an adequate methodology for system and compliance engineering. In addition, the difference of perception and expertise of multiple stakeholders involving in system and compliance engineering further complicates the analyzing, implementing, and assessing of compliance. For these reasons, in many cases, business compliance today is reached on aper-case basis by using ad hoc, hand-crafted solutions for specific rules to which they must comply. This leads in the long run to problems regarding complexity, understandability, and maintainability of compliance concerns in a SOA.

In the coming years, systems that track and record our movements will indispensably be integrated in our everyday life. Location-based systems: dashboard navigation systems, Internet enabled smart phones with GPS features, and electronic tags that help us at various locations are extensively in use. In near future, location-aware/ context aware tools will become more common and sophisticated. Increasing number of services (apps)/devices that will track not only the location, but also the context / environment of the user will enter the market. The perils of exposure on Internet and subsequent exploitation have been widely recorded in literature. Some of the services provided do necessitate the knowledge of exact location, context and some personal details, like in case of assistance during accidents, but generally, applications like finding the restaurants or movies playing in an area do not require the exact location and context of the user. When a user's movement in public spaces is tracked and systematically recorded along with the context of his actions, his contextual privacy is under threat. This paper surveys current state of research in this area and analyses the effect of threat on the privacy of context aware system users. Based on the insight, we propose a novel framework to tackle the privacy preservation issue comprehensively: from user perspective as well as service provider perspective.","","978-1-4673-2624-7978-0-7695-4810","10.1109/CyberC.2012.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385006","Context Aware System (CAS);Privacy Preservation;Privacy Preserving Framework;Architecture for CA Systems","Privacy;Context;Context-aware services;Mobile communication;Cryptography;Sensors;IP networks","4G mobile communication;computer network security;data privacy;Internet;protocols;ubiquitous computing","conceptual framework;critical review;privacy preservation;context aware systems;4G networks;IPv6;IP address;location based systems;dashboard navigation systems;Internet enabled smart phones;GPS features;electronic tags","","3","","40","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In modern CI environments, the selection of measurements (e.g., build status, quality metrics) listed in a dashboard does only change with the intervention of a stakeholder (e.g., a project manager). In this paper, we want to address the shortcoming of static views with so-called Software Quality Assessment (SQA) profiles. SQA-Profiles are defined as rule-sets and enable a dynamic composition of CI dashboards based on stakeholder activities in tools of a CI environment (e.g., version control system).

For this, we mined the commit and issue management activities of PMC members from 20 Apache projects. We implemented a framework to evaluate the performance of our rule-based SQA-Profiles in comparison to a machine learning approach.

This paper focuses on dashboards that have been used on actual large-scale projects as well as example empirical relationships revealed by the dashboards. The empirical results focus on leading indicators for requirements and design of large-scale systems. In the first set of 14 projects focusing on requirements metrics, the ratio of software requirements to source-lines-of code averaged 1:46. Projects that far exceeded the 1:46 requirements-to-code ratio tended to be more effort-intensive and fault-prone during verification. In the second set of 16 projects focusing on design metrics, the components in the top quartile of the number of component internal states had 6.2 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by size. The components in the top quartile of the number of component interactions had 4.3 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by size. When the number of component internal states was in the bottom quartile, the component fault-proneness was low even when the number of component interactions was in the upper quartiles, regardless of size normalization. Measurement-driven dashboards reveal insights that increase visibility into large-scale systems and provide feedback to organizations and projects","1530-1435","0-7695-2371","10.1109/METRICS.2005.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509300","","Large-scale systems;Displays;Project management;Space technology;Information analysis;Feedback;Data analysis;Extraterrestrial measurements;Technology management;Economic forecasting","formal specification;formal verification;large-scale systems;object-oriented programming;software metrics;visual programming","measurement-driven dashboards;system requirements;system design;large-scale systems;system understanding;system evaluation;system development;system management;system economics;interactive graphical display;software requirements;design metrics;system verification;component interaction","","1","","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this work is to demonstrate how Internet of Things and Analytics technologies can bring benefits regarding remote performance monitoring. The intended aim is achieved through the development of a monitoring system concept and its concrete implementation on a Festo Flexible Mechatronics System (MPS 202), a small-scale automated production line. The integration and connection of various sensors allow data collection and communication to a cloud infrastructure, where data are processed and analyzed. Data analytics can highlight key performance metrics that are visualized and streamed on a dashboard, facilitating the understanding of process conditions. The system generates alarms on mobile devices in case of anomalies in the Festo system, allowing users to immediately realize whether an undesired event is occurring in the system. The monitoring system enhances process performance awareness, as key performance metrics such as productivity, cycle time and parts produced are displayed, the cloud infrastructure enables remote visualization and monitoring.

Model-based systems engineering is now so well established in the world of systems engineering that there is no longer questions about the usefulness of such modeling activities. However, it is still difficult to determine what is the current level of quality and how far the models are from the expected project objectives. This paper proposes a framework which reduces the pain of elaborating a quality process aside of the main systems engineering tasks so that a project manager can quickly be aware of the modeling progress statuses. The proposed framework is based on a modeling method which is itself modeled so that to allow a predefined set of modeling artefacts self-learning the quality aspects, and generating the appropriate dashboards at different levels of details.","","978-1-5386-4446-1978-1-5386-4447","10.1109/SysEng.2018.8544381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8544381","Model Quality Assessment;MBSE;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Systems Engineering;Operations Research","Unified modeling language;Mathematical model;Quality assessment;Standards;Data models","description logic;project management;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","modeling activities;expected project objectives;quality process;project manager;quality aspects;descriptive models quality assessment;numerous systems engineering projects;standard metamodels;model-based systems engineering;longer questions;SysML;UML;NAF;artefacts self-learning;progress statuses","","","","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose technology for workplace learning analytics that allows program managers of higher engineering education programs to get insight into the workplace learning of their students, while ensuring privacy of students' personal data by design. Using a design-based agile methodology, we designed and developed a customizable workplace learning dashboard. From the evaluation with program managers in the computing domain, we can conclude that such technology is feasible and promising.

One of the most successful paradigms that can be configured over the cloud is the Service oriented Architecture (SoA) environment, which provides a layered architecture for organising software resources as services, so that they can be deployed, discovered and combined to produce new services. The coordination of the interactions between such services is one of the key challenges of SoA, as any failings in these services could lead to lack of availability, which may violate Service Level Agreements. Therefore, this paper harnesses the capability of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) in order to automate the creation and integration of a Protocol service, which is used to coordinate interactions between services. It is then linked with a real-time Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) dashboard, which is created automatically to monitor the performance of the Protocol service. The approach is implemented as a tool, it also configures the cloud interface to interact with these services.","","978-1-4799-3010","10.1109/CSCI.2014.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822320","Cloud Computing;Web services;Model Driven Architecture;Quality of Service;Coordination;Monitoring","Sensors;Protocols;Monitoring;Business;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Servers","business data processing;cloud computing;protocols;resource allocation;service-oriented architecture","cloud services;monitoring framework;network-based cloud computing;business computing;service oriented architecture environment;SoA environment;software resource as services;service level agreements;model driven architecture;MDA;protocol service;real-time business activity monitoring dashboard;BAM dashboard","","","","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an example, a WiFi environment has been chosen to display the usage of this tool but other context (such as ad-hoc networks) can be studied by adapting its generic entities (nodes, links, and graphics) and input data trace (e.g. signal strength instead of event log) to each situation. The starting point of our study is an overview of the literature on the field of mobility analysis in mobile telecommunication systems. These researches show the importance of understanding wireless usage and provide some related measurements. However, the interpretation of the results of purely statistical nature still remains difficult. For this reason we think that a visualization tool may be a fast and efficient way for characterizing the usage in such environment.

Consequently, monitoring air pollution is currently a critical issue that needs to be addressed for enhancing the well being of citizens. This paper proposes a data analysis engine, based on business intelligence methodologies and open technologies, to support different targeted analysis on air pollution data. To analyse the problem from different facets, air pollution measurements are enriched with additional information such as meteorological and traffic data, which are collected through sensor networks available in the smart city context. This integrated dataset is periodically analyzed to generate informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The informative dashboards can provide useful insights about pollutant concentration at different time granularity levels in the urban areas and support a joint evaluation of pollutant concentrations with climate conditions and traffic flow. As a reference use case, open data on air pollution in the urban area of a major Italian city is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real smart city context.","","978-953-233-086-1978-953-233-088-5978-1-5090-2543","10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522370","","Urban areas;Meteorology;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Air pollution;Temperature measurement","air pollution;data analysis;environmental monitoring (geophysics);environmental science computing;smart cities","air pollution monitoring;urban environment;citizen life quality;data analysis engine;business intelligence methodologies;air pollution measurements;meteorological data;traffic data;sensor networks;smart city;informative dashboards;key performance indicators;KPI;pollutant concentration;time granularity levels;urban areas;climate conditions;traffic flow;Italian city","","3","","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The principal characteristic of the targeted simulations is the coupling of several fusion codes. The principal characteristic of our analytics is that it is highly collaborative in nature. The key to enabling the latter is a backend that allows scientist to perform powerful analyses and visualizations using a Web-portal (i.e., our ""eSimMon"").

In this concept, the search results are grouped and ranked under facets that guide a user on the dimensions through which the search results can be viewed. It has been implemented on web based query systems by integrating with semantic search engines (like Google, Yahoo and Bing). However, there is a significant opportunity of implementing faceted search in business intelligence (BI) frameworks to include direct searching features through BI dashboards and custom reporting interfaces. In this paper, a technology positioning map for implementing faceted search in BI framework on cloud computing has been presented. BI on the cloud is based on massively parallel processing of hardware and database resources and an XML based service oriented architecture in which the data warehouses and OLAP cubes are formed using XML data files. The architecture has been expanded to include a DOM parser and a DTD mapping system that will parse the 2D XML views (pulled from cubes formed by many-to-many XML files) and extract the database fields to be stored in a facet repository as per pre-established metadata rules. Whenever an OLAP query is invoked by a user (using a decision map), a query coordinator will fetch the relevant 2D OLAP views and group them under facets fetched from the facet repository taking the services of a metadata coordinator. The user can make use of the facets to create direct queries, generate the targeted dashboards, and hence reduce searching time.","","978-0-7695-5046","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682162","Faceted search;Business intelligence;OLAP;XML;data files;XML DOM parsing;XML data warehouse;OLAP cubes;Cloud computing","XML;Bismuth;Databases;Business;Films;Data warehouses;Search problems","cloud computing;competitive intelligence;data mining;data warehouses;grammars;meta data;parallel architectures;query processing;search engines;semantic Web;service-oriented architecture;XML","business intelligence;cloud computing;faceted search;direct search query;Web based query system;semantic search engine;BI dashboard;massively parallel processing;hardware resource;database resource;XML based service oriented architecture;data warehouse;XML data file;DOM parser;DTD mapping system;database extraction;facet repository;metadata rule;OLAP query;meta data query coordinator","","","","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the standard voices of different instruments are collected as templates. The test sound is compared with the template sounds when testing, and similarity is calculated. When the similarity is higher than a threshold, test sound and template sound are regarded as the same voice. Otherwise that is not qualified sound and the meter is considered to be defective. The usual way to remove noise was in the time domain. A new approach has been proposed to denoise in the spectral space and obtain the efficiently spectral characteristics of the standard sounds.

"An Offline Framework for Handling Automatic Passenger Counting Raw Data","B. Barabino; M. Di Francesco; S. Mozzoni","NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2014","15","6","2443","2456","Knowledge of ridership data on bus routes is pivotal for the quality and efficient operational planning of public transport companies. Automatic passenger counting (APC) can represent a powerful resource for supporting this activity, because it can provide a databank of accurate counts. However, relevant challenges, such as the matching of data to the bus stop, data validation, tackling anomalies, and building intelligible performance reports, must be faced in order to make APC data a mainstream source of information. This paper proposes an offline framework for addressing these challenges. In order to illustrate a possible application of the framework, its use for setting bus frequencies is investigated.

The dashboard is designed to address the operational needs of air traffic managers in gathering data from multiple sources, thus gaining situational awareness of the NAS status. It monitors several system performance areas in real-time and identifies alerting events, pushing to the user relevant information and notifications regarding evolving problems. (“Pushing” information on a display means autonomous presentation - no query or other interrogation by the user is required.) While high-level system alerts are provided, drill-down information is also available for the user to determine whether further actions are warranted. The dashboard also allows the user to customize the alerts for a specific context by setting thresholds. Field evaluation results suggest that the dashboard capability shortens traffic managers' data acquisition time and, since the dashboard capability is a shared web application, it improves common situational awareness on NAS operations. Ongoing research focuses on calibrating alert thresholds for site-specific needs and expanding the selection of performance metrics enabled by System Wide Information Management feeds.","2155-7209","978-1-5090-2523-7978-1-5090-2524","10.1109/DASC.2016.7778018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778018","traffic flow management;real-time dashboard;monitoring and alerting;data integration","Airports;FAA;Measurement;Public transportation;Feeds;Monitoring;Meteorology","aerospace computing;air traffic control;control engineering computing;data acquisition;Internet;performance evaluation","alerting capability;traffic flow management;real-time monitoring;real-time composite interactive display suite;dashboard capability;national airspace system events;NAS;air traffic managers;high-level system;traffic manager data acquisition time;shared Web application;situational awareness;performance metrics;system wide information management feeds","","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these CCs, operators suffer both with information shortage and overload. This paper focuses on the information overload problem. Operators often do not have adequate access to information that may be relevant in the decision-making process. In many CC centers, information is stored without filtering or refinement for later use, and its visualization is pre-defined at design time, offering no possibility of customization. To address the problems created by this lack of support, we propose an architecture to enable fast and easy selection from multiple information sources, and definition of appropriate visualizations. Following this architecture, we developed the “Emergency Dashboard”, a system that provides selection of a desired set of data and presents it, using configurable dashboards. We also provide collaborative mechanisms, given that, at times, it is not possible for a single user to handle such large datasets alone.","","978-1-5090-1897-0978-1-5090-1819-2978-1-5090-1898","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844746","emergency management;information visualization;dashboard;collaboration","Visualization;Collaboration;Decision making;Computer architecture;Data visualization;Context;Conferences","data visualisation;decision making;emergency services;groupware;information retrieval;software architecture","flexible architecture;information selection;information visualization;emergency command and control centers;crisis situations;information access;decision making;emergency dashboard;collaborative mechanisms","","","","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A chart-like dashboard is the most appropriate tool to make integrated decisions encompassing multiple functions based on relevance information systems. Such tools, however, are commonly used in commercial firms rather than in the public organizations, especially in the education sections. It is crucial that several missions for the higher education in Thailand, such as graduate performance, research study, academic services to the society, and art &amp; culture preservation, need a decision supporting tool to accomplish such goals. In this paper, we propose the dashboard framework for Higher Education, called TheDB (Thailand higher education DashBoard). It is generally very challenging for the higher education to have their own dashboards for different levels in the organization. We have implemented TheDB framework in nursing colleges of Public Health Ministry.

The pedagogical objective of the dashboards is to facilitate formative assessment feedback to students and feed-forward refinements to ongoing instructional practices. The teaching analytics dashboards were evaluated with six university teachers in a bio-metric usability study with integrated physiological and performance measures. Eye-tracking data from the two dashboards showed the relative importance of dashboard areas in each case in terms of aggregate gaze allocation. Findings informed the iterative design of the dashboards leading to teachers not being adversely affected by the visual clutter of the less important dashboard areas in their pedagogical decision-making.

Behind each of these selfies lie the sentiments of the person in the photo posted. The authors of this paper believe that adding quantified sentiment indicators to these selfies can be a valuable addition to not only the social network users but also to the many networks already in existence. Motivated by the idea, the authors propose an addition to social networks that automatically captures the sentiments expressed in selfies as they are being posted. The captured sentiments are then presented along with the selfies' on the users' timeline. In this research, the authors propose Momented, a selfie social network. Momented works by tracking the sentiments expressed in the selfies posted on the Momented social network. Based on the emotions tracked from a particular selfie, the system automatically generates sentiment bearing hashtags.

MYSTREAM leverages the device of users to perform the computational operations on the users' browser, while the server only provides all the necessary material to perform these tasks. In addition, MYSTREAM adopts a stream-based processing approach to identify the relevant contents in a real-time manner. Moreover, the recommendation engine of MYSTREAM is highly modular. Users can build a personalized dashboard by assembling the recommendation modules they prefer to follow the considered event. We implemented and evaluated MYSTREAM using real trace from Twitter.

The proposed methodology employs SPICE-on-top co-simulation environment to simulate the behavioral model in the same SPICE testbench that is used for circuit characterization using SPICE simulations. Circuit characteristics/metrics of interest are defined and checkers are developed to measure them. Results from SPICE and co-simulation runs are compared using automated checkers in a regression environment. A dashboard is generated showing PASS/FAIL status for every metric giving an accurate measure of correlation between the SPICE circuit and the behavioral model. These models are leveraged to run thousands of simulations to predict system performance which is not possible using SPICE circuits.

CityResolver uses an Integer Linear Programming based method to generate a small set of resolution options, and a Signal Temporal Logic based verification approach to compute these resolution options' impact on city performance. The trade-offs between resolution options are shown in a dashboard to support decision makers in selecting the best resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CityResolver by comparing the performance with two baselines: a smart city without conflict resolution, and CityGuard which uses a priority rule-based conflict resolution. Experimental results show that CityResolver can reduce the number of requirement violations and improve the city performance significantly.","","978-1-5386-5301-2978-1-5386-5302","10.1109/ICCPS.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443721","Conflict Resolution;Safety and Performance Requirements;Signal Temporal Logic;Smart City;Smart Services","Smart cities;Signal resolution;Decision support systems;Safety;Noise level;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, CSRs need good support such as having the required valuable information within CCs along with advanced data analytic tools and techniques that make their job of customer identification more efficient. In this paper, we propose a customised Customer Identification (ID) dashboard that provides a summary of customers' profiles to the CSRs.

The paper presents an integrated data mining and Business Intelligence architecture, relying on open technologies, for the analysis of non-emergency open data acquired in a Smart City context. Non-emergency data are first enriched with additional information related to the context of the warning reports and then analyzed offline to generate (i) informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and (iii) association rules representing implications between warning categories and contextual information (e.g., city areas, districts, time slots).

"Accelerating Analytics for Clinical Pathways to Drive Cost Reduction and Quality Improvement","J. McGlothlin","NA","2018 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI)","","2018","","","426","435","Healthcare systems in the United States are under extreme pressure to simultaneously lower costs and improve patient outcomes. There is no global approach to achieve this. Instead, the most successful methodology is to establish quality standards of care and protocols specific to each acute disease. The challenge with this approach is that there is significant level of effort and time required to design and develop each protocol, adjust workflows, gather and aggregate the data and create analytics dashboards to monitor performance and drive improvement. We have found that it takes twelve weeks or more to extract the data and develop the analytics dashboards for a clinical pathway for one disease. This is an extremely worthwhile exercise which we have performed for high-volume and high-risk disease cohorts, but it is simply untenable to do this for all acute diseases. In this project, we provide a solution to accelerate the creation of clinical pathways, acute disease metrics and analytics dashboards. We use data analysis and upfront data processing, producing a solution that is data-driven rather than tool-driven. This solution allows us to create acute care quality programs and analytics dashboards more rapidly with less work effort. Additionally, we can use the same data analysis to help define better programs, rather than simply measure pre-defined protocol metrics.","","978-1-5386-2659-7978-1-5386-2660","10.1109/IRI.2018.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424740","healthcare informatics;business intelligence;data warehousing;visualizations;industry experience;patient quality;supervised learning","Diseases;Hospitals;Measurement;Protocols;Medical diagnostic imaging","cost reduction;data aggregation;data analysis;diseases;health care;medical administrative data processing;patient diagnosis","acute care quality programs;analytics dashboards;data analysis;clinical pathway;healthcare systems;United States;patient outcomes;acute disease metrics;data processing;cost reduction;quality improvement;high risk disease cohorts;high volume disease cohorts;pre defined protocol metrics","","","","48","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Architecture to Enable Dual Reality for Smart Environments","G. Kahl; C. Bürckert","NA; NA","2012 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Environments","","2012","","","42","49","In this paper, we describe an architecture that brings the Dual Reality paradigm into intelligent environments also referred to as smart spaces. This architecture aims at enhancing the development of already existing and of new (or future) assistance systems for these smart spaces including the possibility for pre-testing without installing them in the real environment. All information, either really sensed or simulated, can be transmitted in real time from the intelligent environment to a corresponding virtual representation reflecting the real world and vice versa based on an event-based communication infrastructure. Users can interact with the virtual model using a dashboard-like visualization, which also offers the possibility to run simulators and other services that are probably not yet installed in the smart space. The advantages of both worlds can be used to enrich assistance systems and to improve the adaptation of these systems taking the current context into account. We describe a smart space running this new infrastructure. In this instrumented shopping environment, all sensors and actuators can communicate with each other using the event-based infrastructure. Besides that, all data is also transmitted to a Management Dashboard and visualized adequately. In this dashboard-like visualization, a store manager can access all data sensed in the environment and control some installed actuators. We describe briefly how this infrastructure can be used for testing a price tag framework, which offers the ability to generate images that can be transferred to and displayed at electronic shelf labels. Before installing this service in the real environment, the testing is performed in the virtual model using data from the real world. After a successful test phase, the service can be established in the smart shopping environment with very little effort.","","978-1-4673-2093-1978-0-7695-4741","10.1109/IE.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258501","Event-based Communication Infrastructure;Management Dashboard;Dual Reality;3D Visualization","Databases;Synchronization;Intelligent sensors;Servers;Visualization;Java","data visualisation;image processing;retail data processing;virtual reality","dual reality architecture;smart environments;intelligent environments;smart spaces;assistance systems;pretesting;real environment;virtual representation;event-based communication infrastructure;virtual model;dashboard-like visualization;systems adaptation;instrumented shopping environment;sensors;actuators;management dashboard;store manager;data access;price tag framework;image generation;electronic shelf labels","","1","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While designing manual specification can be very expressive, it demands high efforts to make effective decisions, therefore reducing exploratory speed. Instead, principled automated designs can increase exploratory speed, decrease learning efforts, help avoid ineffective decisions, and therefore better support data analytics novices. Towards these goals, we present Keshif, a new systematic design for tabular data exploration. To summarize a given dataset, Keshif aggregates records by value within attribute summaries, and visualizes aggregate characteristics using a consistent design based on data types. To reveal data distribution details, Keshif features three complementary linked selections: highlighting, filtering, and comparison. Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction. We show examples selected from 160+ datasets from diverse domains. Our study with novices shows that after exploring raw data for 15 minutes, our participants reached close to 30 data insights on average, comparable to other studies with skilled users using more complex tools.","1077-2626;1941-0506;2160-9306","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2723393","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC); U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968338","Interactive data exploration and discovery;data visualization;data exploration;graphical user interfaces;interaction;design;user-centered design","Data visualization;Visualization;Data analysis;Aggregates;Data models;Encoding","data analysis;data handling;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces","learning efforts;systematic design;attribute summaries;data types;data distribution details;aggregate metrics;absolute/part-of scale modes;automated design approach;fluid interaction;data analytics novices;tabular data exploration;record aggregation;time 15.0 min","","","","41","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This helps the datacenter management team to take immediate action to rectify this temperature deviation. Also this can be monitored from anywhere anytime over online dashboard by the senior level professionals who are not present in the data centre at any point in time. This Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based monitoring system consists of temperature sensors, ESP8266 and Wi-Fi router. ESP8266 is a low power, highly integrated Wi-Fi solution from Espress if. The ESP8266 here, in this prototype, connects to `Ubidots' cloud through its API for posting temperature data to the cloud dashboard on real time and the cloud event management system generates alerts whenever the high temperature alert event is fired. Cloud events need to be configured for different alerts beforehand through the user friendly user interface of the platform. It's to be noted that the sensor used here can be leveraged to monitor the relative humidity of the data center environment as well along with the temperature of the data center.

However, prior work largely focuses on capturing clinician-defined, patient-generated data in adult oncology care. Emerging research at the intersection of human-computer interaction and medical informatics suggests that visual narratives of patients' observations of daily living (Visual ODLs) could better support multi-party review of patients' everyday symptoms and quality of life, potentially improving patient-clinician communication. In this paper, we build on a prior study of Visual ODLs by describing a formative, two-phase study with 15 pediatric oncology clinicians. In Phase I, we analyzed data from ethnographic interviews in a pediatric oncology setting to capture the needs of nurses, nurse practitioners, and oncologists. In Phase II, we constructed two low-fidelity dashboard display prototypes, populated with Visual ODLs contributed by actual adolescent oncology patients, and we subsequently interviewed pediatric oncology clinicians who re-viewed each dashboard design. Findings from our study contribute four key design objectives for presenting interactive Visual ODL dashboards in pediatric oncology, along with three use cases for using these dashboards for symptom tracking and communication.","2575-2634","978-1-5386-5377-7978-1-5386-5378","10.1109/ICHI.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419370","Graphical user interfaces;health information management;oncology;pediatrics;chronic care management;healthcare informatics;user–computer interface;symptom assessment;patient-centered outcomes research;patient-generated data;user interface design","Visualization;Cancer;Oncology;Interviews;Informatics;User interfaces","biomedical equipment;cancer;data visualisation;health care;medical information systems;paediatrics;patient care;patient treatment;tumours;user interfaces","patient-generated data;clinician-defined;adult oncology care;visual narratives;daily living;patient-clinician communication;prior study;two-phase study;pediatric oncology setting;actual adolescent oncology patients;interactive Visual ODL dashboards;integrating patient-generated observations;pediatric cancer care;formative user interface design study;recorded observations of daily living;patient-reported outcomes data;PRO data;Visual ODL;human-computer interaction;medical informatics;pediatric oncology clinicians;nurse practitioners;oncologists;low-fidelity dashboard display prototypes","","","","41","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, information overload is a key challenge in leveraging this big data resource for organizations. We present an interactive user-feedback based streaming analytics system `CitizenHelper-Adaptive' to mine social media, news, and other public Web data streams for emergency services and humanitarian organizations. The system aims to collect, organize, and visualize the vast amounts of data across various user and content-based information attributes using the adaptive machine learning models, such as intent classification models to continuously identify requests for help or offers of help during disasters. This demonstration shows the first application of transfer-active learning methods for time-critical events, when there is an availability of abundant labeled data from past events but a scarcity of the sufficient labeled data for the ongoing event. The proposed system provides a user interface to solicit expert feedback on the predicted instances from pretrained models and actively learns to improve the models for efficient information processing and organization. Finally, the system regularly updates the predicted information categories in the visualization dashboard.
