While biologists and bioinformaticists can take an analytical job and execute it on their personal workstations, it remains challenging to seamlessly execute the job on the cloud infrastructure without extensive knowledge of the cloud dashboard. How analytical jobs can not only with minimum effort be executed on the cloud, but also how both the resources and data required by the job can be managed is explored in this paper. An open-source light-weight framework for executing R-scripts using Bioconductor packages, referred to as `RBioCloud', is designed and developed.

An open-source platform OpenStack used for provisioning cloud environment is gaining tremendous popularity. OpenStack introduces independent projects developed for providing specific services in the cloud. These services interact with each other to act as one cloud environment. The services are managed using commands and require knowledge of their usage. To make the management of the services more convenient OpenStack has designed and developed a user interface based project called Horizon. It is a web-based interface which interacts with other services to make them configurable and manageable through a dashboard. In this paper, we will discuss the present scenario of the services interacting with Horizon.","","978-1-5386-4430-0978-1-5386-4429-4978-1-5386-4431","10.1109/ICCCNT.2018.8493661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493661","Cloud computing;OpenStack;Horizon;User interface","Cloud computing;Containers;Tools;Standards;Software;Heating systems;User interfaces","cloud computing;public domain software;user interfaces","Horizon;web-based user interface;cloud computing;open-source platform OpenStack;cloud environment","","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Customer Scenario Focused End-to-End Testing","C. Liang; A. Malatpure; M. Shafiei; M. Vago; T. Zheng","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops","","2012","","","80","81","End to end testing is critical for ensuring the quality of a software product. Popular software products are deployed by customers in a wide variety of configurations over a broad range of hardware. Testing efforts, being subject to normal business constraints (limited time and resources) do not find it possible to recreate all customer scenarios in-house. In such a situation, it is valuable to understand how to model a wide range of customer scenarios so that their shared elements and unique traits can be distinguished from each other. Given such a modeling approach, it is necessary to know how to build a testing infrastructure that can utilize traditional functional tests, but reorient them in a way that provides high customer scenario coverage at optimal cost. In this paper, we model customer scenarios from the perspective of the services they enable. Services typically have multiple categories of users, with each category expecting the service to provide functionality catering to its unique requirements. This setup is modeled in our approach by using the 'Persona -- Experience - Usecase' hierarchy. Persona refers to the different categories of users that utilize a service. Experience refers to the user experiences that each user category expects from the service. Usecases clarify the specific requirements of the distinct functionality expected by each user category. Using such a persona-experience-usecase hierarchy to model customer scenarios helps demarcate requirements common to multiple scenarios from those that are specific to certain deployments. We create the scenario test model to test the corresponding experiences and usecases for different personas. The test model consists of topologies and schemas. A test topology helps capture the uniqueness associated with each scenario. It is further split into 2 parts viz. roles (that capture the various software settings associated with the customer scenario) and configurations (that capture the hardware setup, a.k.a. machine-network-storage combination associated with the customer scenario). A test schema captures the test activities related to the customer scenarios. It consists of 'action groups', with each action group being associated with a usecase for the customer scenario. Thus the 'Persona - Experience - Usecase' hierarchy in customer scenario modeling broadly corresponds to the 'Test Scenario - Topology, TestSchema - Roles, Configurations, Action Groups' hierarchy in the test object model. Multi-functional, service oriented customer scenarios require that core experiences associated with each persona continue to be met during the different states of the service. We have used the concept of 'Service Level Agreements (SLAs)' to capture such core experiences to validate their continued satisfaction. Most real-world customer deployments are susceptible to hardware and software faults. We have explicitly added faults (both hardware and software) to our object model to test service resiliency under such conditions. In a customer scenario, SLAs and faults are typically associated with usecases. We have used a similar association in the test object model to compose action groups from 3 sources viz. user actions, faults and user SLAs. We implemented the proposed approach in the development cycle for Windows Server 2012. The implementation manifested as a testing infrastructure with four major components namely: deployment creator, test scheduler, monitoring system and reporting dashboard. A flexible deployment creator configured different test topologies (i.e. fileserver, high availability clustering, networking and storage variations). Action groups consisted of traditional functional tests, specially written SLA tests and simulated hardware, software faults. A smart stochastic scheduler coordinated these action groups and was used to simulate persona-experience patterns. A monitoring system gathered 2 distinct types of information, viz.: action group success status and system health indicators. Finally a rich reporting dashboard was used to overlay this information in a continuous time graph for quality assurance and issue triage. The above testing infrastructure enabled us to find issues that had been missed in traditional functional and stress tests. We targeted multiple customer scenarios and found a good mix of issues spanning different features in the software. These results increase our confidence in this approach and we propose to evolve it further going forward.","","978-1-4673-5048-8978-0-7695-4928","10.1109/ISSREW.2012.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405421","end to end testing;system testing;scenario testing;software testing;customer scenario modeling","Software;Testing;Hardware;Topology;Network topology;Monitoring;Abstracts","program testing;software quality;software reliability","end-to-end testing;software product;persona-experience-usecase hierarchy;scenario test model;action group;test object model;multifunctional customer scenario;service oriented customer scenario;service level agreement;SLA;deployment creator;test scheduler;monitoring system;reporting dashboard;continuous time graph","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are based on technologies such as REST, WSDL, and SOAP which are hardly understandable by the end-user. In this paper, we propose a widget based service exposure and service creation tool. Our framework creates links between loaded widgets automatically; additional functionalities are thus added automatically to existing widgets as long as the end-user loads other widgets to his personal environment; in the same way as he launches an application on his Windows environment.

Despite the multiple advantages of demand response to such residential customers, they are often reluctant to participate in such programs because of privacy concerns or because they are unaware of time-based rates. In this study, a customer dashboard was developed to enhance and persuade customers to participate in demand response programs. The online dashboard was used to increase awareness of all customer types, which is essential for ensuring a significant increase of DR participants. Incorporating flexibility, ease-of-use, and rewards programs will attract customers to use the dashboard thus expanding customer awareness to consciously or subconsciously change energy consumption behaviors. Making such cultural changes in customer behaviors leads to a long term solution for participation in demand response programs.

However, as the integration cycles become shorter, the amount of data increases, and the effort to find information in CI environments becomes substantial. In modern CI environments, the selection of measurements (e.g., build status, quality metrics) listed in a dashboard does only change with the intervention of a stakeholder (e.g., a project manager). In this paper, we want to address the shortcoming of static views with so-called Software Quality Assessment (SQA) profiles. SQA-Profiles are defined as rule-sets and enable a dynamic composition of CI dashboards based on stakeholder activities in tools of a CI environment (e.g., version control system). We present a set of SQA-Profiles for project management committee (PMC) members: Bandleader, Integrator, Gatekeeper, and Onlooker. For this, we mined the commit and issue management activities of PMC members from 20 Apache projects. We implemented a framework to evaluate the performance of our rule-based SQA-Profiles in comparison to a machine learning approach. The results showed that project-independent SQA-Profiles can be used to automatically extract the profiles of PMC members with a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 0.78.","1534-5351","978-1-4799-8469","10.1109/SANER.2015.7081840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081840","","Data mining;Software;Logic gates;Electronic mail;Control systems;Project management;Communities","knowledge based systems;software quality;source code (software)","SQA profile;software quality assessment;rule-based activity profile;continuous integration environment;CI;source code change;software project","","4","","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on dashboards that have been used on actual large-scale projects as well as example empirical relationships revealed by the dashboards. The empirical results focus on leading indicators for requirements and design of large-scale systems. In the first set of 14 projects focusing on requirements metrics, the ratio of software requirements to source-lines-of code averaged 1:46. Projects that far exceeded the 1:46 requirements-to-code ratio tended to be more effort-intensive and fault-prone during verification. In the second set of 16 projects focusing on design metrics, the components in the top quartile of the number of component internal states had 6.2 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by size. The components in the top quartile of the number of component interactions had 4.3 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by size. When the number of component internal states was in the bottom quartile, the component fault-proneness was low even when the number of component interactions was in the upper quartiles, regardless of size normalization.

Task and process feedback were the pedagogical actions most often used following dashboard consultation. Additionally, teachers who consulted the dashboard more often activated more and more diverse pedagogical knowledge to interpret the data and, consequently, gave more and more diverse feedback.

However, it is still difficult to determine what is the current level of quality and how far the models are from the expected project objectives. This paper proposes a framework which reduces the pain of elaborating a quality process aside of the main systems engineering tasks so that a project manager can quickly be aware of the modeling progress statuses. The proposed framework is based on a modeling method which is itself modeled so that to allow a predefined set of modeling artefacts self-learning the quality aspects, and generating the appropriate dashboards at different levels of details.","","978-1-5386-4446-1978-1-5386-4447","10.1109/SysEng.2018.8544381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8544381","Model Quality Assessment;MBSE;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Systems Engineering;Operations Research","Unified modeling language;Mathematical model;Quality assessment;Standards;Data models","description logic;project management;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","modeling activities;expected project objectives;quality process;project manager;quality aspects;descriptive models quality assessment;numerous systems engineering projects;standard metamodels;model-based systems engineering;longer questions;SysML;UML;NAF;artefacts self-learning;progress statuses","","","","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, monitoring air pollution is currently a critical issue that needs to be addressed for enhancing the well being of citizens. This paper proposes a data analysis engine, based on business intelligence methodologies and open technologies, to support different targeted analysis on air pollution data. To analyse the problem from different facets, air pollution measurements are enriched with additional information such as meteorological and traffic data, which are collected through sensor networks available in the smart city context. This integrated dataset is periodically analyzed to generate informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The informative dashboards can provide useful insights about pollutant concentration at different time granularity levels in the urban areas and support a joint evaluation of pollutant concentrations with climate conditions and traffic flow. As a reference use case, open data on air pollution in the urban area of a major Italian city is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real smart city context.","","978-953-233-086-1978-953-233-088-5978-1-5090-2543","10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522370","","Urban areas;Meteorology;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Air pollution;Temperature measurement","air pollution;data analysis;environmental monitoring (geophysics);environmental science computing;smart cities","air pollution monitoring;urban environment;citizen life quality;data analysis engine;business intelligence methodologies;air pollution measurements;meteorological data;traffic data;sensor networks;smart city;informative dashboards;key performance indicators;KPI;pollutant concentration;time granularity levels;urban areas;climate conditions;traffic flow;Italian city","","3","","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a side effect, continuous and timely feedback helps developers and maintenance personnel improve their skills and thereby decreases the likelihood of future quality defects. To make regular quality control feasible, it must be highly automated, and assessment results must be presented in an aggregated manner to avoid overwhelming users with data.

In this concept, the search results are grouped and ranked under facets that guide a user on the dimensions through which the search results can be viewed. It has been implemented on web based query systems by integrating with semantic search engines (like Google, Yahoo and Bing). However, there is a significant opportunity of implementing faceted search in business intelligence (BI) frameworks to include direct searching features through BI dashboards and custom reporting interfaces. In this paper, a technology positioning map for implementing faceted search in BI framework on cloud computing has been presented. BI on the cloud is based on massively parallel processing of hardware and database resources and an XML based service oriented architecture in which the data warehouses and OLAP cubes are formed using XML data files. The architecture has been expanded to include a DOM parser and a DTD mapping system that will parse the 2D XML views (pulled from cubes formed by many-to-many XML files) and extract the database fields to be stored in a facet repository as per pre-established metadata rules. Whenever an OLAP query is invoked by a user (using a decision map), a query coordinator will fetch the relevant 2D OLAP views and group them under facets fetched from the facet repository taking the services of a metadata coordinator. The user can make use of the facets to create direct queries, generate the targeted dashboards, and hence reduce searching time.","","978-0-7695-5046","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682162","Faceted search;Business intelligence;OLAP;XML;data files;XML DOM parsing;XML data warehouse;OLAP cubes;Cloud computing","XML;Bismuth;Databases;Business;Films;Data warehouses;Search problems","cloud computing;competitive intelligence;data mining;data warehouses;grammars;meta data;parallel architectures;query processing;search engines;semantic Web;service-oriented architecture;XML","business intelligence;cloud computing;faceted search;direct search query;Web based query system;semantic search engine;BI dashboard;massively parallel processing;hardware resource;database resource;XML based service oriented architecture;data warehouse;XML data file;DOM parser;DTD mapping system;database extraction;facet repository;metadata rule;OLAP query;meta data query coordinator","","","","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic passenger counting (APC) can represent a powerful resource for supporting this activity, because it can provide a databank of accurate counts. However, relevant challenges, such as the matching of data to the bus stop, data validation, tackling anomalies, and building intelligible performance reports, must be faced in order to make APC data a mainstream source of information. This paper proposes an offline framework for addressing these challenges. In order to illustrate a possible application of the framework, its use for setting bus frequencies is investigated. The results are represented by easy-to-read control dashboards composed of tables and graphs. The methodology is experimentally tested with data records provided by the bus operator CTM in Cagliari, Italy.

In many CC centers, information is stored without filtering or refinement for later use, and its visualization is pre-defined at design time, offering no possibility of customization. To address the problems created by this lack of support, we propose an architecture to enable fast and easy selection from multiple information sources, and definition of appropriate visualizations. Following this architecture, we developed the “Emergency Dashboard”, a system that provides selection of a desired set of data and presents it, using configurable dashboards.

The proposed approach is derived from the classical continuous improvement concept e.g. PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, which has been adapted to most of the real industrial and production environments. The approach consists of four phases : Monitor, Analysis, Recommendations and Action (MARA); these phases are summarized into two segmented information panel viz. Application Health Dashboards and Corrective Action Dashboard. It allows customizing the dashboard as per the level of visibility required in order to improve the monitoring process. This paper also includes a case study of monitoring the application performance in live environment. The case study discussed in the paper shows the application of basic principles for continuous performance improvement while deploying APM solution for monitoring and prediction of performance trends. The proposed approach lifts the possibility to apply this methodology to wide scale of enterprises applications for domains such as Telecom, Banking, Insurance, Ecommerce, Healthcare etc and most importantly to the mission critical enterprise applications, which actually have direct impact on organization's potential to drive business revenue.

MYSTREAM leverages the device of users to perform the computational operations on the users' browser, while the server only provides all the necessary material to perform these tasks. In addition, MYSTREAM adopts a stream-based processing approach to identify the relevant contents in a real-time manner. Moreover, the recommendation engine of MYSTREAM is highly modular. Users can build a personalized dashboard by assembling the recommendation modules they prefer to follow the considered event. We implemented and evaluated MYSTREAM using real trace from Twitter. We show that MYSTREAM is effective to follow an event from Twitter, particularly the live recommendation module quickly identifies the most valuable contents over time.

Circuit characteristics/metrics of interest are defined and checkers are developed to measure them. Results from SPICE and co-simulation runs are compared using automated checkers in a regression environment. A dashboard is generated showing PASS/FAIL status for every metric giving an accurate measure of correlation between the SPICE circuit and the behavioral model.

Therefore, CSRs need good support such as having the required valuable information within CCs along with advanced data analytic tools and techniques that make their job of customer identification more efficient. In this paper, we propose a customised Customer Identification (ID) dashboard that provides a summary of customers' profiles to the CSRs.

The paper presents an integrated data mining and Business Intelligence architecture, relying on open technologies, for the analysis of non-emergency open data acquired in a Smart City context. Non-emergency data are first enriched with additional information related to the context of the warning reports and then analyzed offline to generate (i) informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and (iii) association rules representing implications between warning categories and contextual information (e.g., city areas, districts, time slots). KPIs and rules are exploited to selectively notify to municipality actors (assessors, area operators) potentially critical situations, according to their role and authority.

"Accelerating Analytics for Clinical Pathways to Drive Cost Reduction and Quality Improvement","J.

There is no global approach to achieve this. Instead, the most successful methodology is to establish quality standards of care and protocols specific to each acute disease. The challenge with this approach is that there is significant level of effort and time required to design and develop each protocol, adjust workflows, gather and aggregate the data and create analytics dashboards to monitor performance and drive improvement. We have found that it takes twelve weeks or more to extract the data and develop the analytics dashboards for a clinical pathway for one disease. This is an extremely worthwhile exercise which we have performed for high-volume and high-risk disease cohorts, but it is simply untenable to do this for all acute diseases. In this project, we provide a solution to accelerate the creation of clinical pathways, acute disease metrics and analytics dashboards. We use data analysis and upfront data processing, producing a solution that is data-driven rather than tool-driven. This solution allows us to create acute care quality programs and analytics dashboards more rapidly with less work effort. Additionally, we can use the same data analysis to help define better programs, rather than simply measure pre-defined protocol metrics.","","978-1-5386-2659-7978-1-5386-2660","10.1109/IRI.2018.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424740","healthcare informatics;business intelligence;data warehousing;visualizations;industry experience;patient quality;supervised learning","Diseases;Hospitals;Measurement;Protocols;Medical diagnostic imaging","cost reduction;data aggregation;data analysis;diseases;health care;medical administrative data processing;patient diagnosis","acute care quality programs;analytics dashboards;data analysis;clinical pathway;healthcare systems;United States;patient outcomes;acute disease metrics;data processing;cost reduction;quality improvement;high risk disease cohorts;high volume disease cohorts;pre defined protocol metrics","","","","48","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Architecture to Enable Dual Reality for Smart Environments","G. Kahl; C. Bürckert","NA; NA","2012 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Environments","","2012","","","42","49","In this paper, we describe an architecture that brings the Dual Reality paradigm into intelligent environments also referred to as smart spaces. This architecture aims at enhancing the development of already existing and of new (or future) assistance systems for these smart spaces including the possibility for pre-testing without installing them in the real environment. All information, either really sensed or simulated, can be transmitted in real time from the intelligent environment to a corresponding virtual representation reflecting the real world and vice versa based on an event-based communication infrastructure. Users can interact with the virtual model using a dashboard-like visualization, which also offers the possibility to run simulators and other services that are probably not yet installed in the smart space. The advantages of both worlds can be used to enrich assistance systems and to improve the adaptation of these systems taking the current context into account. We describe a smart space running this new infrastructure. In this instrumented shopping environment, all sensors and actuators can communicate with each other using the event-based infrastructure. Besides that, all data is also transmitted to a Management Dashboard and visualized adequately. In this dashboard-like visualization, a store manager can access all data sensed in the environment and control some installed actuators. We describe briefly how this infrastructure can be used for testing a price tag framework, which offers the ability to generate images that can be transferred to and displayed at electronic shelf labels. Before installing this service in the real environment, the testing is performed in the virtual model using data from the real world. After a successful test phase, the service can be established in the smart shopping environment with very little effort.","","978-1-4673-2093-1978-0-7695-4741","10.1109/IE.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258501","Event-based Communication Infrastructure;Management Dashboard;Dual Reality;3D Visualization","Databases;Synchronization;Intelligent sensors;Servers;Visualization;Java","data visualisation;image processing;retail data processing;virtual reality","dual reality architecture;smart environments;intelligent environments;smart spaces;assistance systems;pretesting;real environment;virtual representation;event-based communication infrastructure;virtual model;dashboard-like visualization;systems adaptation;instrumented shopping environment;sensors;actuators;management dashboard;store manager;data access;price tag framework;image generation;electronic shelf labels","","1","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards these goals, we present Keshif, a new systematic design for tabular data exploration. To summarize a given dataset, Keshif aggregates records by value within attribute summaries, and visualizes aggregate characteristics using a consistent design based on data types. To reveal data distribution details, Keshif features three complementary linked selections: highlighting, filtering, and comparison. Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction. We show examples selected from 160+ datasets from diverse domains. Our study with novices shows that after exploring raw data for 15 minutes, our participants reached close to 30 data insights on average, comparable to other studies with skilled users using more complex tools.","1077-2626;1941-0506;2160-9306","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2723393","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC); U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968338","Interactive data exploration and discovery;data visualization;data exploration;graphical user interfaces;interaction;design;user-centered design","Data visualization;Visualization;Data analysis;Aggregates;Data models;Encoding","data analysis;data handling;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces","learning efforts;systematic design;attribute summaries;data types;data distribution details;aggregate metrics;absolute/part-of scale modes;automated design approach;fluid interaction;data analytics novices;tabular data exploration;record aggregation;time 15.0 min","","","","41","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Customizing existing platforms and designing specific boards, are among the important task to perform an accurate visualization of the information. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of data visualization, its techniques and existing dashboard platforms. We implemented a generic and dynamic dashboard based on real-time information with the aim to assess the impact of the available Data Visualization Techniques in the developed dashboard. Therefore, our Dashboard users will be able to interact with the information, based on an initial set of hints, charts, tables and reports, produced by the Dashboard itself. This will allow us to test an existing set of data visualization techniques and create a new tailored dashboard, showing that dashboards can become a unique and powerful means to provide information.","","978-989-98434-8-6978-1-5386-4885","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8398641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8398641","Data visualization techniques;dashboard;real-time information;platform;tailored","Data visualization;Visualization;Tools;Business;Real-time systems;Correlation;Mobile handsets","data visualisation","generic dashboard;dynamic dashboard;real-time information;Dashboard users;tailored dashboard;accurate visualization;data visualization techniques;dashboard platforms;board designing","","","","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Integrating Patient-Generated Observations of Daily Living into Pediatric Cancer Care: A Formative User Interface Design Study","U. Lakshmi; M. Hong; L. Wilcox","NA; NA; NA","2018 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","","2018","","","265","275","Patient-generated data, such as recorded Observations of Daily Living (ODL) and Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) data, are valued sources of information in oncology care. However, prior work largely focuses on capturing clinician-defined, patient-generated data in adult oncology care. Emerging research at the intersection of human-computer interaction and medical informatics suggests that visual narratives of patients' observations of daily living (Visual ODLs) could better support multi-party review of patients' everyday symptoms and quality of life, potentially improving patient-clinician communication. In this paper, we build on a prior study of Visual ODLs by describing a formative, two-phase study with 15 pediatric oncology clinicians. In Phase I, we analyzed data from ethnographic interviews in a pediatric oncology setting to capture the needs of nurses, nurse practitioners, and oncologists. In Phase II, we constructed two low-fidelity dashboard display prototypes, populated with Visual ODLs contributed by actual adolescent oncology patients, and we subsequently interviewed pediatric oncology clinicians who re-viewed each dashboard design. Findings from our study contribute four key design objectives for presenting interactive Visual ODL dashboards in pediatric oncology, along with three use cases for using these dashboards for symptom tracking and communication.","2575-2634","978-1-5386-5377-7978-1-5386-5378","10.1109/ICHI.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419370","Graphical user interfaces;health information management;oncology;pediatrics;chronic care management;healthcare informatics;user–computer interface;symptom assessment;patient-centered outcomes research;patient-generated data;user interface design","Visualization;Cancer;Oncology;Interviews;Informatics;User interfaces","biomedical equipment;cancer;data visualisation;health care;medical information systems;paediatrics;patient care;patient treatment;tumours;user interfaces","patient-generated data;clinician-defined;adult oncology care;visual narratives;daily living;patient-clinician communication;prior study;two-phase study;pediatric oncology setting;actual adolescent oncology patients;interactive Visual ODL dashboards;integrating patient-generated observations;pediatric cancer care;formative user interface design study;recorded observations of daily living;patient-reported outcomes data;PRO data;Visual ODL;human-computer interaction;medical informatics;pediatric oncology clinicians;nurse practitioners;oncologists;low-fidelity dashboard display prototypes","","","","41","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analyzing clickstreams on MOOC videos poses a special analytical challenge but provides a good opportunity for understanding how students interact with course videos, which in turn can help instructors and educational analysts gain insights into online learning behavior. In this poster, we develop a visual analytical system, VisMOOC, to help instructors analyze the clickstream data. VisMOOC consists of three main views: the List View to list all course videos for analysts to select the video they are interested in; the Content-based View to show how each type of click actions change along the video timeline, which enables the most viewed sections to be observed and the most interesting patterns to be discovered; The Dashboard View shows the information of the clickstream data in different aspects, including the course information, the geographic distribution, the video temporal information, the video popularity, and the animation. Furthermore, case studies made by the instructors demonstrate the usefulness of VisMOOC and helped them gaining deep insights into learning behavior for MOOCs.","","978-1-4799-6227","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042528","","Visualization;Data visualization;Animation;Image color analysis;Presses;Abstracts;Streaming media","behavioural sciences computing;computer aided instruction;computer animation;data analysis;data visualisation;educational courses;human computer interaction;video signal processing","VisMOOC;video clickstream data visualization;massive open online courses;clickstream data analysis;online learning behavior;visual analytical system;list view;content-based view;video selection;video timeline;dashboard view;course information;geographic distribution;video temporal information;video popularity;animation","","4","","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"CitizenHelper-Adaptive: Expert-Augmented Streaming Analytics System for Emergency Services and Humanitarian Organizations","R. Pandey; H. Purohit","George Mason University, Department of Information Sciences and Technology, Fairfax, United States; George Mason University, Department of Information Sciences and Technology, Fairfax, United States","2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)","","2018","","","630","633","There is an increasing amount of information posted on Web, especially on social media during real world events. Likewise, there is a vast amount of information and opinions posted about humanitarian issues on social media. Mining such data can provide timely knowledge to inform disaster resource allocation for who needs what and where as well as policies for humanitarian causes. However, information overload is a key challenge in leveraging this big data resource for organizations. We present an interactive user-feedback based streaming analytics system `CitizenHelper-Adaptive' to mine social media, news, and other public Web data streams for emergency services and humanitarian organizations. The system aims to collect, organize, and visualize the vast amounts of data across various user and content-based information attributes using the adaptive machine learning models, such as intent classification models to continuously identify requests for help or offers of help during disasters. This demonstration shows the first application of transfer-active learning methods for time-critical events, when there is an availability of abundant labeled data from past events but a scarcity of the sufficient labeled data for the ongoing event. The proposed system provides a user interface to solicit expert feedback on the predicted instances from pretrained models and actively learns to improve the models for efficient information processing and organization. Finally, the system regularly updates the predicted information categories in the visualization dashboard. We will demo CitizenHelper-Adaptive system for case studies in both mass emergency events and humanitarian related topics such as gender violence using datasets of more than 50 million Twitter messages and news streams collected between 2016 and 2018.","2473-991X;2473-9928","978-1-5386-6051-5978-1-5386-6052","10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8508374","adaptive systems;online streams;social media mining;transfer active learning;humanitarian technology","Social network services;Organizations;Data mining;Data visualization;Metadata;Training","Big Data;data mining;disasters;emergency services;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","expert-augmented streaming analytics system;emergency services;humanitarian organizations;social media;world events;humanitarian issues;disaster resource allocation;humanitarian causes;information overload;public Web data streams;content-based information;adaptive machine learning models;intent classification models;transfer-active learning methods;time-critical events;abundant labeled data;sufficient labeled data;user interface;expert feedback;pretrained models;organization;predicted information categories;CitizenHelper-Adaptive system;mass emergency events;humanitarian related topics;data mining;big data resource;information processing;interactive user-feedback based streaming analytics system","","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
