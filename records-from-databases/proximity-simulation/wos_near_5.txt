This paper recaps the GDPR articles that should be noticed by software designers and developers and explains how, from the perspective of computer scientists, the summarized requirements can be implemented based on state-of-the-art technologies, such as data provenance tracking, distributed usage control, and remote attestation protocols. For this, the challenges for data controllers, i.e., the service providers, as well as for the data subjects, i.e., the users whose personal data are being processed by the services, are worked out. As a result, this paper proposes the ideal functionality of a next-generation privacy dashboard interacting with data provenance and usage control infrastructure implemented at the service providers to operationalize the legal rights of the data subject granted by the GDPR. Finally, it briefly outlines the options for establishing trust in data provenance tracking and usage control infrastructures operated by the service providers themselves.

To present an overview of these indicators, hospital-wide QS (HWQS) dashboards are designed. There is little evidence how these dashboards are developed. The challenges faced to develop these dashboards in Dutch hospitals were retrospectively studied. Methods 24 focus group interviews were conducted: 12 with hospital managers (n=25; 39.7%) and 12 support staff (n=38; 60.3%) in 12 of the largest Dutch hospitals. Open and axial codings were applied consecutively to analyse the data collected. Results A heuristic tool for the general development process for HWQS dashboards containing five phases was identified. In phase 1, hospitals make inventories to determine the available data and focus too much on quantitative data relevant for accountability. In phase 2, hospitals develop dashboard content by translating data into meaningful indicators for different users, which is not easy due to differing demands. In phase 3, hospitals search for layouts that depict the dashboard content suited for users with different cognitive abilities and analytical skills. In phase 4, hospitals try to integrate dashboards into organisational structures to ensure that data are systematically reviewed and acted on. In phase 5, hospitals want to improve the flexibility of their dashboards to make this adaptable under differing circumstances. Conclusion The literature on dashboards addresses the technical and content aspects of dashboards, but overlooks the organisational development process. This study shows how technical and organisational aspects are relevant in development processes.	[Weggelaar-Jansen, Anne Marie J. W. M.; Broekharst, Damien S.

Improving Community Health Worker performance by using a personalised feedback dashboard for supervision: a randomised controlled trial	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							CHILDHOOD ILLNESS STRATEGY; CASE-MANAGEMENT; INDEPENDENT EVALUATION; MOTIVATION; MORTALITY; PROGRAM; MALAWI	Background Countries across sub-Saharan Africa are scaling up Community Health Worker (CHW) programmes, yet there remains little high-quality research assessing strategies for CHW supervision and performance improvement. This randomised controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of a personalised performance dashboard used as a supervision tool on the quantity, speed, and quality of CHW care. Methods We conducted a randomised controlled trial in a large health catchment area in peri-urban Mali. One hundred forty-eight CHWs conducting proactive case-finding home visits were randomly allocated to receive individual monthly supervision with or without the CHW Performance Dashboard from January to June 2016. Randomisation was stratified by CHW supervisor, level of CHW experience, and CHW baseline performance for monthly quantity of care (number of household visits). With regression analysis, we used a difference-in-difference model to estimate the effect of the intervention on monthly quantity, timeliness (percentage of children under five treated within 24 hours of symptom onset), and quality (percentage of children under five treated without protocol error) of care over a six-month post-intervention period relative to a three-month pre-intervention period. Results Use of the Dashboard during monthly supervision significantly increased the mean number of home visits by 39.94 visits per month (95% CI = 3.56-76.3; P = 0.031). Estimated effects on secondary outcomes of timeliness and quality were positive but not statistically significant. Across both study arms, CHW quantity, timeliness, and quality of care significantly improved over the study period, during which time all CHWs received dedicated monthly supervision, although effects plateaued over time. Conclusions Our findings suggest that dedicated monthly supervision and personalised feedback using performance dashboards can increase CHW productivity. Further operational research is needed to understand how to sustain the performance improvements over time.

The specification of Arden Syntax, however, would in principle also support multi-patient CDS. The patient data management system (PDMS) at our local intensive care units does not natively support patient overviews from customizable CDS routines, but local physicians indicated a demand for multi-patient tabular overviews of important clinical parameters such as key laboratory measurements. As our PDMS installation provides Arden Syntax support, we set out to explore the capability of Arden Syntax for multi-patient CDS by implementing a prototypical dashboard for visualizing laboratory findings from patient sets. Methods and material: Our implementation leveraged the object data type, supported by later versions of Arden, which turned out to be serviceable for representing complex input data from several patients. For our prototype, we designed a modularized architecture that separates the definition of technical operations, in particular the control of the patient context, from the actual clinical knowledge. Individual Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) for processing single patient attributes could then be developed according to well-tried Arden Syntax conventions. Results: We successfully implemented a working dashboard prototype entirely in Arden Syntax. The architecture consists of a controller MLM to handle the patient context, a presenter MLM to generate a dashboard view, and a set of traditional MLMs containing the clinical decision logic. Our prototype could be integrated into the graphical user interface of the local PDMS. We observed that with realistic input data the average execution time of about 200 ms for generating dashboard views attained applicable performance. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the general feasibility of creating multi-patient CDS routines in Arden Syntax. We believe that our prototypical dashboard also suggests that such implementations can be relatively easy, and may simultaneously hold promise for sharing dashboards between institutions and reusing elementary components for additional dashboards.

Recently, dashboards have received the spotlight as health information technology to support these tasks. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development of a real-time autonomous dashboard for the ED and to evaluate perspectives of clinical staff on its usability. Methods: We developed a dashboard based on three principles-"anytime, anywhere, at a glance;" "minimal interruption to workflow;" and "protect patient privacy"-and 3 design features-"geographical layout," "patient-level alert," and "real-time summary data." Items to evaluate the dashboard were selected based on the throughput factor of the conceptual model of ED crowding. Moreover, ED physicians and nurses were surveyed using the system usability scale (SUS) and situation awareness index as well as a questionnaire we created on the basis of the construct of the Situation Awareness Rating Technique. Results: The first version of the ED dashboard was successfully launched in 2013, and it has undergone 3 major revisions since then because of geographical changes in ED and modifications to improve usability. A total of 52 ED staff members participated in the survey. The average SUS score of the dashboard was 67.6 points, which indicates "OK-to-Good" usability. The participants also reported that the dashboard provided efficient "concentration support" (4.15 points), "complexity representation" (4.02 points), "variability representation" (3.96 points), "information quality" (3.94 points), and "familiarity" (3.94 points). However, the "division of attention" was rated at 2.25 points. Conclusions: We developed a real-time autonomous ED dashboard and successfully used it for 5 years with good evaluation from users.

Use of Routine Prospective Functional and Aesthetic Patient Satisfaction Measurements in Secondary Cleft Lip Rhinoplasty	JAMA FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article							EVALUATION NOSE SCALE; NASAL OBSTRUCTION; VALIDATION; APPEARANCE; BENEFITS	IMPORTANCE Patients, governments, health care providers, and insurance companies show an increased interest in health outcomes, especially in centralized medical care, such as deft lip nose treatment. Transparent outcome reporting requires a thorough methodological design, dedicated prospective data collection process, and, preferably, no interference with the efficacy of daily practice. OBJECTIVE To describe the implementation of an automated and prospective secondary cleft lip rhinoplasty outcome routine. DESIGN,SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective analytic cohort pilot study was conducted among 123 consecutive patients referred for secondary cleft lip rhinoplasty from July 1, 2014, to March 31, 2018, at an academic teaching hospital. EXPOSURES Secondary cleft lip rhinoplasty or revision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Preoperative and 3- and 12-month postoperative scores on the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale (range 0-100. lower scores indicate better outcome), Utrecht Questionnaire (range 0-100, lower scores indicate better outcome), and visual analog scales (range 0-10: 0, no obstruction; 10, completely blocked nose) were obtained. Data were exported for automated statistical outcome analysis that was supported by graphic output on a customized web-based dashboard. RESULTS Of the 123 patients (68 male and 55 female; mean age, 23 years [range, 17-68 years]) included in the outcome routine, 103 patients (57 male and 46 female; mean age, 22 years [range, 17-50 years]) were eligible for surgery. The web-based dashboard provided demographic characteristics, reasons that surgery was not performed or indicated, and real-time, short- and long-term change in functional and aesthetic outcome after secondary cleft lip rhinoplasty. Among 66 patients with sufficient follow-up, mean (SD) Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation sum scores after rhinoplasty improved from 30.8 (27.6), which is comparable to a moderate problem, to 19.2 (22.2), which is comparable to a very mild problem (P < .001), and mean Utrecht Questionnaire sum scores decreased from 13.1 (5.6) to 7.1(3.3) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Routine prospective outcome monitoring provides an evidence-based response to the increasing demand for transparency in health care. The web-based dashboard used during patient counseling, selection, and management of expectations has the potential to compare results of secondary cleft lip rhinoplasty between surgeons and institutions provided that the populations share similar characteristics. The administrative interference with a busy daily practice was limited.	[van Zijl, Floras V. W. J.; van der Poel, Egge F.; de Jong, Robert J.

Effect of Social Comparison Feedback on Laboratory Test Ordering for Hospitalized Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CLINICAL-TRIAL; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIANS; MANAGEMENT; RESIDENTS; STRATEGY; IMPACT; RECORD	Social comparison feedback is an increasingly popular strategy that uses performance report cards to modify physician behavior. Our objective was to test the effect of such feedback on the ordering of routine laboratory tests for hospitalized patients, a practice considered overused. This was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Between January and June 2016, physicians on six general medicine teams at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were cluster randomized with equal allocation to two arms: (1) those e-mailed a summary of their routine laboratory test ordering vs. the service average for the prior week, linked to a continuously updated personalized dashboard containing patient-level details, and snapshot of the dashboard and (2) those who did not receive the intervention. The primary outcome was the count of routine laboratory test orders placed by a physician per patient-day. We modeled the count of orders by each physician per patient-day after the intervention as a function of trial arm and the physician's order count before the intervention. The count outcome was modeled using negative binomial models with adjustment for clustering within teams. One hundred and fourteen interns and residents participated. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in adjusted reduction in routine laboratory ordering between the intervention and control physicians (physicians in the intervention group ordered 0.14 fewer tests per patient-day than physicians in the control group, 95% CI - 0.56 to 0.27, p = 0.50). Physicians whose absolute ordering rate deviated from the peer rate by more than 1.0 laboratory test per patient-day reduced their laboratory ordering by 0.80 orders per patient-day (95% CI - 1.58 to - 0.02, p = 0.04). Personalized social comparison feedback on routine laboratory ordering did not change targeted behavior among physicians, although there was a significant decrease in orders among participants who deviated more from the peer rate.

This work presents CrisMap, a Big Data crisis mapping system capable of quickly collecting and analyzing social media data. CrisMap extracts potential crisis-related actionable information from tweets by adopting a classification technique based on word embeddings and by exploiting a combination of readily-available semantic annotators to geoparse tweets. The enriched tweets are then visualized in customizable, Web-based dashboards, also leveraging ad-hoc quantitative visualizations like choropleth maps. The maps produced by our system help to estimate the impact of the emergency in its early phases, to identify areas that have been severely struck, and to acquire a greater situational awareness. We extensively benchmark the performance of our system on two Italian natural disasters by validating our maps against authoritative data. Finally, we perform a qualitative case-study on a recent devastating earthquake occurred in Central Italy.

Recent studies state that the entropy velocity law allows expeditive methodology for discharge estimation and rating curve development due to the simple mathematical formulation and implementation. Many works have been developed based on the one-dimensional (1-D) formulation of the entropy velocity profile, supporting measurements in the lab and the field for rating curve assessment, but in recent years, the two-dimensional (2-D) formulation was proposed and applied in studies of regular ditch flow, showing good performance. The present work deals with a comparison between the 1-D and 2-D approaches in order to give a general framework of threats and opportunities related to the robust operational application of such laws. The analysis was carried out on a laboratory ditch with regular roughness, under controlled boundary conditions, and in different stages, generating an exhaustive dashboard for better appraisal of the approaches.

Being able to monitor the health status of such components and platforms, along with the overall health status of the operation supported by such information systems is of paramount importance. The immediate solution for these monitoring needs is to use vendor specific applications, which results in having to look and understand several different interfaces. As it will be explained, there are available solutions that integrate such needs on a single platform. However, these solutions failed to provide a monitoring dashboard for the entire system operation, with highly customizable dashboard interface, easily defined metrics and easy mobile application availability. This paper describes an architecture for configurable dashboards capable of presenting heterogeneous metrics, side by side, regardless of their origin. A prototype, based on such architecture, is presented as a proof of concept. This prototype is being used to monitor the Cape Verde's Justice Information System. The result, based on the proposed architecture and prototype, is a custom tool with a single configuration file that can be adapted to different thresholds, metrics and monitoring scenarios.

The model combines both the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytical network process (DANP) with a fuzzy integral method. The DANP method is used to construct the network system and derives the weights. The fuzzy integral method is applied to avoid inconsistent assumptions between the interdependence relation and linear aggregation for obtaining the aspiration-gaps of green suppliers. Last, the visualized dashboard allows for a clear representation of the interdependent-network structure of the attributes to assist companies in the selection of suitable suppliers, as well as assisting the suppliers in improving their performance with higher levels of service. A Taiwanese Electronics Company is demonstrated as an example. The results demonstrate that the dashboard can enable managers to make better decisions from a systematic perspective.

Increasing productivity with smartphone digital imagery wound measurements and analysis	JOURNAL OF WOUND CARE			English	Article						cost; digital imagery; documentation; productivity; smartphone; time		Objective: The primary aim was to determine the productivity increase using digital imagery for better documentation and analysis. A case series was done in a specialised care centre with patients managed with advanced dressings and using state-of-the-art smartphone technology for documentation to save costs and time. Method: Wounds were cleansed and debrided before using the application to photograph, document, measure and analyse the wounds. The smartphone app was oriented parallel to the plane of the wound, where possible, to obtain accurate measurements. A longitudinal study report was generated for each wound and showed the progress of the wound healing until the wound was closed. Results: A sample size of 60 patients consisting of wounds from different locations, and a total of 203 measurements and analyses were conducted over a period of seven months. The wound monitoring app proved to be effective for wound monitoring and required less than two hours' training. A report summary of wounds recorded could also be generated automatically through the dashboard. All 60 patients' cases were automatically recorded, measured and presented into reports for use in clinical analysis. There was a significant time savings (27 hours per day for a specialised care centre with 10 nurses) increase over manual wound documentation and measuring methods. Conclusion: The app provided a non-contact, easy to use, reliable and accurate smart wound management solution for clinicians and physicians to track wound healing in patients. The app could also be used by patients and caregivers for home monitoring of their wounds.	[Nair, Harikrishna K.

Clinical dashboards are a promising method to assist various aspects of the decision-making process in such cognitively demanding scenarios. However, in order to provide extensive and intuitive assistance to the participating physicians, the design and development of such a system have to be user-centric. To accomplish this task, conceptual methods need to be performed prior to the technical development and integration stages. Methods We have conducted a qualitative survey including eight clinical experts with different levels of expertise in the field of head and neck oncology. According to the principles of information architecture, the survey focused on the identification and causal interconnection of necessary metrics for information assessment in the tumor board. Results Based on the feedback by the clinical experts, we have constructed a detailed map of the required information items for a tumor board dashboard in head and neck oncology. Furthermore, we have identified three distinct groups of metrics (patient, disease and therapy metrics) as well as specific recommendations for their structural and graphical implementation. Conclusion By using the information architecture, we were able to gather valuable feedback about the requirements and cognitive processes of the tumor board members. Those insights have helped us to develop a dashboard application that closely adapts to the specified needs and characteristics, and thus is primarily user-centric.

Proactive post-marketing surveillance is necessary to assess whether the vaccination uptake and the B/R profile are as expected and, ultimately, whether further public health or regulatory actions are needed. There are several, typically not integrated, facets of post-marketing vaccine surveillance: the surveillance of vaccination coverage, vaccine safety, effectiveness and impact. With this work, we aim to assess the feasibility and added value of using an interactive dashboard as a potential methodology for near real-time monitoring of vaccine coverage and pre-specified health benefits and risks of vaccines. We developed a web application with an interactive dashboard for B/R monitoring. The dashboard is demonstrated using simulated electronic healthcare record data mimicking the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in the UK. The interactive dashboard allows end users to select certain parameters, including expected vaccine effectiveness, age groups, and time periods and allows calculation of the incremental net health benefit (INHB) as well as the incremental benefit-risk ratio (IBRR) for different sets of preference weights. We assessed the potential added value of the dashboard by user testing amongst a range of stakeholders experienced in the post-marketing monitoring of vaccines. The dashboard was successfully implemented and demonstrated. The feedback from the potential end users was generally positive, although reluctance to using composite B/R measures was expressed. The use of interactive dashboards for B/R monitoring is promising and received support from various stakeholders. In future research, the use of such an interactive dashboard will be further tested with real-life data as opposed to simulated data.

Keshif: Rapid and Expressive Tabular Data Exploration for Novices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Interactive data exploration and discovery; data visualization; data exploration; graphical user interfaces; interaction; design; user-centered design	VISUAL ANALYSIS; VISUALIZATIONS; DESIGN	General purpose graphical interfaces for data exploration are typically based on manual visualization and interaction specifications. While designing manual specification can be very expressive, it demands high efforts to make effective decisions, therefore reducing exploratory speed. Instead, principled automated designs can increase exploratory speed, decrease learning efforts, help avoid ineffective decisions, and therefore better support data analytics novices. Towards these goals, we present Keshif, a new systematic design for tabular data exploration. To summarize a given dataset, Keshif aggregates records by value within attribute summaries, and visualizes aggregate characteristics using a consistent design based on data types. To reveal data distribution details, Keshif features three complementary linked selections: highlighting, filtering, and comparison. Keshif further increases expressiveness through aggregate metrics, absolute/part-of scale modes, calculated attributes, and saved selections, all working in synchrony. Its automated design approach also simplifies authoring of dashboards composed of summaries and individual records from raw data using fluid interaction. We show examples selected from 160+ datasets from diverse domains. Our study with novices shows that after exploring raw data for 15 minutes, our participants reached close to 30 data insights on average, comparable to other studies with skilled users using more complex tools.

An Electronic Dashboard to Monitor Patient Flow at the Johns Hopkins Hospital: Communication of Key Performance Indicators Using the Donabedian Model	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Systems engineering; Dashboard; Patient flow; Hospital capacity; Hospital overcrowding	HEALTH-CARE; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; OPERATING-ROOM; DISCHARGE; INFORMATION; NOON; TIME; IMPLEMENTATION; ASSOCIATION; IMPROVEMENT	Efforts to monitoring and managing hospital capacity depend on the ability to extract relevant time-stamped data from electronic medical records and other information technologies. However, the various characterizations of patient flow, cohort decisions, sub-processes, and the diverse stakeholders requiring data visibility create further overlying complexity. We use the Donabedian model to prioritize patient flow metrics and build an electronic dashboard for enabling communication. Ten metrics were identified as key indicators including outcome (length of stay, 30-day readmission, operating room exit delays, capacity-related diversions), process (timely inpatient unit discharge, emergency department disposition), and structural metrics (occupancy, discharge volume, boarding, bed assignation duration). Dashboard users provided real-life examples of how the tool is assisting capacity improvement efforts, and user traffic data revealed an uptrend in dashboard utilization from May to October 2017 (26 to 148 views per month, respectively). Our main contributions are twofold. The former being the results and methods for selecting key performance indicators for a unit, department, and across the entire hospital (i.e., separating signal from noise). The latter being an electronic dashboard deployed and used at The Johns Hopkins Hospital to visualize these ten metrics and communicate systematically to hospital stakeholders. Integration of diverse information technology may create further opportunities for improved hospital capacity.

Effect of an Automated Patient Dashboard Using Active Choice and Peer Comparison Performance Feedback to Physicians on Statin Prescribing The PRESCRIBE Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD; INCREASE; OUTPATIENT; PREVENTION; DELIVERY; INSIGHTS; IMPROVE; DISEASE	IMPORTANCE Statins are not prescribed to approximately 50% of patients who could benefit from them. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of an automated patient dashboard using active choice framing with and without peer comparison feedback on performance to nudge primary care physicians (PCPs) to increase guideline-concordant statin prescribing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-arm cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 21, 2017, to April 21, 2017, at 32 practice sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Participants included 96 PCPs and 4774 patients not previously receiving statin therapy. Data were analyzed from April 25, 2017, to June 16, 2017. INTERVENTIONS Primary care physicians in the 2 intervention arms were emailed a link to an automated online dashboard listing their patients who met national guidelines for statin therapy but had not been prescribed this medication. The dashboard included relevant patient information, and for each patient, PCPs were asked to make an active choice to prescribe atorvastatin, 20 mg, once daily, atorvastatin at another dose, or another statin or not prescribe a statin and select a reason. The dashboard was available for 2 months. In 1 intervention arm, the email to PCPs also included feedback on their statin prescribing rate compared with their peers. Primary care physicians in the usual care group received no interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statin prescription rates. RESULTS Patients had a mean (SD) age of 62.4 (8.3) years and a mean (SD) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score of 13.6 (8.2); 2625 (55.0%) were male, 3040 (63.7%) were white, and 1318 (27.6%) were black. In the active choice arm, 16 of 32 PCPs (50.0%) accessed the patient dashboard, but only 2 of 32 (6.3%) signed statin prescription orders. In the active choice with peer comparison arm, 12 of 32 PCPs (37.5%) accessed the patient dashboard and 8 of 32 (25.0%) signed statin prescription orders. Statins were prescribed in 40 of 1566 patients (2.6%) in the usual care arm, 116 of 1743 (6.7%) in the active choice arm, and 117 of 1465 (8.0%) in the active choice with peer comparison arm. In the main adjusted model, compared with usual care, there was a significant increase in statin prescribing in the active choice with peer comparison arm (adjusted difference in percentage points, 5.8; 95% CI, 0.9-13.5; P = .008), but not in the active choice arm (adjusted difference in percentage points, 4.1; 95% CI, -0.8 to 13.1; P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An automated patient dashboard using both active choice framing and peer comparison feedback led to a modest but significant increase in guideline-concordant statin prescribing rates.

The goal of myAva is to integrate the tools of precision health and principals of a learning health system to improve care for women, starting with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: Putting patients at the center in designing a new style of healthcare has been an important concept underlying the development of myAva since inception. Understanding the needs of patients and providers is key to the development of myAva. Surveys were collected from members of the PCOS patient community and patient and medical advisory boards were recruited. For the pilot group comprehensive omic data, biometric and self-reported data were collected and integrated into a personalized health dashboard enabling providers to formulate personalized treatment plans. The ongoing collection of data will create continuous improvement of healthcare. Results: Precision health for chronic issues faced is in its infancy and although myriad challenges exist the potential to improve health outcomes is great. myAva's providers, patients. and advisors are encouraged by the early outcomes of the program with improved health outcomes and an increased sense of empowerment reported. It is clear that designing and implementing this type of care requires collaboration, the involvement of all stakeholders, with patients at the center.

However, most software tools are designed to support the tactical and operational levels, while at a strategic level there are not many options available. In this paper, we propose a software tool which supports modelling of strategic information, covering several well-known strategy techniques, and also facilitates the design of highly customizable management dashboards. To validate our proposed software tools, we perform two case studies, with two inherently different organizations, namely a public university and an investment fund.

Supervision of CHWs by qualified health professionals is the main link between this lay workforce and the formal health system. The quality of services provided by lay health workers is dependent on adequate supportive supervision. It is however one of the weakest links in CHW programs due to logistical and resource constraints, especially in large scale programs. Interventions such as point of care testing using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) require real time monitoring to ensure diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we evaluated the utility of a mobile health technology platform to remotely monitor malaria RDT (mRDT) testing by CHWs for quality improvement. Methods As part of a large implementation trial involving mRDT testing by CHWs, we introduced the Fionet system composed of a mobile device (Deki Reader, DR) to assist in processing and automated interpretation of mRDTs, which connects to a cloud-based database which captures reports from the field in real time, displaying results in a custom dashboard of key performance indicators. A random sample of 100 CHWs were trained and provided with the Deki Readers and instructed to use it on 10 successive patients. The CHWs interpretation was compared with the Deki Reader's automatic interpretation, with the errors in processing and interpreting the RDTs recorded. After the CHW entered their interpretation on the DR, the DR provided immediate, automated feedback and interpretation based on its reading of the same cassette. The study team monitored the CHW performance remotely and provided additional support. Results A total of 1251 primary and 113 repeat tests were performed by the 97 CHWs who used the DR. 91.6% of the tests had agreement between the DR and the CHWs. There were 61 (4.9%) processing and 52 (4.2%) interpretation errors among the primary tests. There was a tendency towards lower odds of errors with increasing number and frequency of tests, though not statistically significant. Of the 62 tests that were repeated due to errors, 79% achieved concordance between the CHW and the DR. Satisfaction with the use of the DR by the CHWs was high. Conclusions Use of innovative mHealth strategies for monitoring and quality control can ensure quality within a large scale implementation of community level testing by lay health workers.

A prototype has been developed which can provide enormous data collection capabilities from smart meters, in order to realise an adequate SA level in microgrids. A communication framework based on the publish-subscribe model is also proposed and implemented for the communication layer of the SA using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol over two different physical (PHY) layers (i.e., WiFi and GPRS). An Internet of things (IoT) platform (i.e., Thingsboard) is used for the SA visualisation with a customised dashboard. It is shown by using the developed system, an adequate level of SA can be achieved with a minimum installation and hardware cost. Moreover, the Modbus protocol over the RS-485 is applied for the smart meter communication.

This chapter advocates a holistic approach based on a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model in order to build a dashboard of indicators. Coral reefs should be studied as a social ecological system, which means to (a) monitor the ecosystem and the socio-system in the same areas, (b) involve stakeholders and citizens to improve the spatial representativeness of monitored stations, (c) monitor the dynamics of watersheds, including mapping the land use changes and modeling the soil erodibility. The dashboard of indicators should prioritize adaptive management at the local scale instead of reporting at the worldwide scale.

Customizing existing platforms and designing specific boards, are among the important task to perform an accurate visualization of the information. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of data visualization, its techniques and existing dashboard platforms. We implemented a generic and dynamic dashboard based on real-time information with the aim to assess the impact of the available Data Visualization Techniques in the developed dashboard. Therefore, our Dashboard users will be able to interact with the information, based on an initial set of hints, charts, tables and reports, produced by the Dashboard itself. This will allow us to test an existing set of data visualization techniques and create a new tailored dashboard, showing that dashboards can become a unique and powerful means to provide information.

There are several reasons for this lack of interoperability between linked data and analytics, including representation issues and inability to exploit the full potential of linked data. In this paper we present "YourDataStories", an infrastructure that tries to minimise the gap between linked data (where RDF is dominant) and Web-based analytics platforms (where JSON is dominant), through the use of technologies like JSON-LD, Hydra, and a set of reusable visualisation components, which do not depend on a specific semantic model and can adapt to almost any semantic model. The presented infrastructure has been used to create a set of visualisation applications, ranging from Web visual applications (such as facet search, dashboards, and "wizard-like" interfaces allowing various kind of stakeholders to find, understand and consume the data), to mobile and social media applications that inform citizens and gather their feedback. Having as a central component the model analyser, which retrieves and analyses a semantic model (based on OWL and SKOS) from a triple store, the resulting infrastructure and applications allow users to "drill-down" on the available data and extract subsets of interest, which can be analysed through pre-configured and user-driven custom visualisations and dashboards.

Business intelligence visual analytics tools like dashboards can be used to navigate, manipulate, and convert such big data into actionable knowledge. The combined use of clinical dashboards with MS registries can provide near real-time surveillance to improve patient outcomes when appropriately configured. The first step for dashboard development is to determine its key performance indicators (KPIs). Method: This qualitative study was conducted in 2017. Interviews with neurologists for requirement analysis was performed after studying the MS registries' aims and indicators in leading countries. The face and content validity and also reliability of the questionnaire were assessed by expert's opinions and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. In order to make a consensus about dashboard KPIs, Delphi technique was applied. Results: A set of 45 KPIs was developed for the MS surveillance registry dashboard and categorized into three layers-country layer, regional layer, and patient layer-with 7, 28, and 10 indicators, respectively, in each layer. Conclusion: The first step to develop the MS surveillance registry dashboard is to determine its key performance indicators.

Learning analytics endeavors in higher education have primarily focused on classroom-based learning. Recently, workplace learning analytics has become an emergent research area, with target users being workers, students and trainers. We propose technology for workplace learning analytics that allows program managers of higher engineering education programs to get insight into the workplace learning of their students, while ensuring privacy of students' personal data by design. Using a design-based agile methodology, we designed and developed a customizable workplace learning dashboard. From the evaluation with program managers in the computing domain, we can conclude that such technology is feasible and promising. The proposed technology was designed to be generaliz able to other (engineering) domains. A next logical step would be to evaluate and improve the proposed technology within other engineering domains.

Few of the leading agile project management tools have been compared to arrive at an understanding of the level of support for the requirements management features. Also, Agile-Scrum practitioners have been surveyed to achieve insight into tools being used for requirements management in the software industry. It was observed that a few key features like user role modeling and Persona, customer feedback are not available in most of the tools. We have implemented a tool called "AgileRE" which has all the basic requirements management features. The tool empowers product owners to create and manage requirements in the form of user stories. The tool allows customers and Scrum team members to collaborate on the user stories. The tool built in cloud infrastructure, is accessed through a web browser interface and has a simple workflow. Some of the key features the "AgileRE" tool provides are: role-based access for product owners, customers, and the agile team, Persona creation, epic and user story management and life-cycle, customer feedback and sign off, dashboard and reports.

That requires, that the CERT/CSIRT research and develops new security tools. Therefore, our study focuses on the design of an integral model based on Business Intelligence (BI), which provides reactive and proactive services in a CSIRT, in order to alert and reduce any suspicious or malicious activity on information systems and data networks. To achieve this purpose, a solution has been assembled, that generates information stores, being compiled from a continuous network transmission of several internal and external sources of an organization. However, it contemplates a data warehouse, which is focused like a correlator of logs, being formed by the information of feeds with diverse formats. Furthermore, it analyzed attack detection and port scanning, obtained from sensors such as Snort and Passive Vulnerability Scanner, which are stored in a database, where the logs have been generated by the systems. With such inputs, we designed and implemented BI systems using the phases of the Ralph Kimball methodology, ETL and OLAP processes. In addition, a software application has been implemented using the SCRUM methodology, which allowed to link the obtained logs to the BI system for visualization in dynamic dashboards, with the purpose of generating early alerts and constructing complex queries using the user interface through objects structures. The results demonstrate, that this solution has generated early warnings based on the level of criticality and level of sensitivity of malware and vulnerabilities as well as monitoring efficiency, increasing the level of security of member institutions.

The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) provides national decision makers and global stakeholders with opportunities to benchmark and accelerate performance improvement through better performance measurement. Results from the initial PHC performance assessments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are helping guide PHC reforms and investments and improve the PHCPI's instruments and indicators. Findings from future assessment activities will further amplify cross-country comparisons and peer learning to improve PHC. New indicators and sources of data are needed to better understand PHC system performance in LMICs. ContextThe Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI), a collaboration between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The World Bank, and the World HealthOrganization, in partnership with Ariadne Labs and Results for Development, was launched in 2015 with the aim of catalyzing improvements in primary health care (PHC) systems in 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in order to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage. Through more comprehensive and actionable measurement of quality PHC, the PHCPI stimulates peer learning among LMICs and informs decision makers to guide PHC investments and reforms. Instruments for performance assessment and improvement are in development; to date, a conceptual framework and 2 sets of performance indicators have been released. MethodsThe PHCPI team developed the conceptual framework through literature reviews and consultations with an advisory committee of international experts. We generated 2 sets of performance indicators selected from a literature review of relevant indicators, cross-referenced against indicators available from international sources, and evaluated through 2 separate modified Delphi processes, consisting of online surveys and in-person facilitated discussions with experts. FindingsThe PHCPI conceptual framework builds on the current understanding of PHC system performance through an expanded emphasis on the role of service delivery. The first set of performance indicators, 36 Vital Signs, facilitates comparisons across countries and over time. The second set, 56 Diagnostic Indicators, elucidates underlying drivers of performance. Key challenges include a lack of available data for several indicators and a lack of validated indicators for important dimensions of quality PHC. ConclusionsThe availability of data is critical to assessing PHC performance, particularly patient experience and quality of care. The PHCPI will continue to develop and test additional performance assessment instruments, including composite indices and national performance dashboards. Through country engagement, the PHCPI will further refine its instruments and engage with governments to better design and finance primary health care reforms.

SHERLOCK: Experimental Evaluation of a Conversational Agent for Mobile Information Tasks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Controlled natural language (CNL); conversational interface; human-computer collaboration (HCC); human-machine interaction (HMI); tactical intelligence	MACHINE	Controlled natural language (CNL) has great potential to support human-machine interaction (HMI) because it provides an information representation that is both human readable and machine processable. We investigated the effectiveness of a CNL-based conversational interface forHMIin a behavioral experiment called simple human experiment regarding locally observed collective knowledge (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK, individuals acted in groups to discover and report information to the machine using natural language (NL), which the machine then processed into CNL. The machine fused responses from different users to form a common operating picture, a dashboard showing the level of agreement for distinct information. To obtain information to add to this dashboard, users explored the real world in a simulated crowd-sourced sensing scenario. This scenario represented a simplified controlled analog for tactical intelligence (i.e., direct intelligence of the environment), which is key for rapidly planning military, law enforcement, and emergency operations. Overall, despite close to zero training, 74% of the users inputted NL that was machine interpretable and addressed the assigned tasks. An experimental manipulation aimed to increase user-machine interaction, however, did not improve performance as hypothesized. Nevertheless, results indicate that the conversational interface may be effective in assisting humans with collection and fusion of information in a crowdsourcing context.

In this paper, we describe a National Dutch Railways project in which we identify the major determinants of customer satisfaction. By combining multiple data sources, we link operational and marketing data to customer satisfaction. Our models show that train punctuality and sufficient seating within a train are important factors in customer satisfaction, as are other service elements, such as the availability of Wi-Fi in a train and the condition of facilities at a station. Drawing on the model results, the National Dutch Railways pursued initiatives to increase customer satisfaction. Among these initiatives is the development of an application that allows passengers to check seating availability, the design of a marketing dashboard reflecting developments in customer satisfaction, and the creation of a tool to identify the most critical determinants of customer satisfaction.

Dashboards are often composed of different data visualization techniques, amongst which are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which play a crucial role in quickly providing accurate information by comparing current performance against a target required to fulfil business objectives. However, KPIs are not always well known and sometimes it is difficult to find an appropriate KPI to associate with each business objective. In addition, Data Mining techniques are often used when forecasting trends and visualizing data correlations. In this paper we present a new approach to combining these two aspects in order to drive Data Mining techniques to obtain specific KPIs for business objectives in a semi-automated way. The main benefit of our approach is that organizations do not need to rely on existing KPI lists or test KPIs over a cycle as they can analyze their behavior using existing data. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we apply our proposal to the fields of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Data extracted from the University of Alicante in order to identify the KPIs.

Transparency in Functional Rhinoplasty: Benefits of Routine Prospective Outcome Measurements in a Tertiary Referral Center	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							AESTHETIC RHINOPLASTY; NASAL APPEARANCE; SURGERY	Background: Patients, governments, health care providers, and insurance companies are increasingly interested in medical performance. Transparent outcome reporting requires a thorough methodologic design, dedicated prospective data collection process, and preferably no interference with the efficacy of daily practice. The primary aim of this article is to describe how these bottlenecks are tackled with an automated prospective rhinoplasty outcome routine. The secondary aim is to motivate others by describing practical benefits encountered during implementation. Methods: Since April 2014, 269 consecutive patients referred for functional-aesthetic (revision) rhinoplasty were included. The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale, the Utrecht Questionnaire, and visual analogue scales were offered to all patients before primary consultation and follow-up to translate the subjective burden of nasal problems and change herein following surgery, into data. These data were exported for real-time automated outcome analysis supported by graphic output through a customized Web-based dashboard. Results: One hundred seventy-one patients proved eligible for rhinoplasty, of which 121 had sufficient follow-up. The dashboard provides an overview of demographic characteristics of different populations, reasons why rhinoplasties were not performed, and real-time short-and long-term change in functional and aesthetic outcome in both primary and revision cases. Practical benefits of the instruments used are presented and discussed. Conclusions: Routine prospective outcome monitoring provides an evidence-based response to the increasing demand for transparency in health care. The dashboard proved valuable during patient counseling, patient selection, and management of expectations and has the potential to compare rhinoplasty results between surgeons and institutions, provided that the populations share similar characteristics.

Despite the emergence of dashboards as an easy way to present data to students, students have had limited involvement in the dashboard development process. As part of a larger program of research examining student and academic perceptions of learning analytics, we report here on work in progress exploring student perceptions of dashboards and student preferences for dashboard features. First, we present findings on higher education students' attitudes towards learning analytic dashboards resulting from four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes relating to dashboards: 'provide everyone with the same learning opportunities', 'to compare or not to compare', 'dashboard privacy', 'automate alerts' and 'make it meaningful-give me a customizable dashboard'. Next we present findings from a content analysis of students' drawings of dashboards demonstrating that students are interested in features that support learning opportunities, provide comparisons to peers and are meaningful to the student. Finally, we present preliminary findings from a survey of higher education students, reinforcing students' desire to choose whether to have a dashboard and to be able to customize their dashboards. These findings highlight the potential for providing students with some level of control over learning analytics as a means to increasing self-regulated learning and academic achievement. Future research directions aimed at better understanding students emotional and behavioral responses to learning analytics feedback on dashboards and alerts are outlined.

In particular, the "one-size-fits-all" design of many existing systems is questioned based on findings in related research on performance feedback and student motivation which has shown that various internal and external student-level factors affect the impact of feedback interventions, especially those using social comparisons. Integrating data from student information systems into underlying algorithms to produce personalized dashboards may mediate the possible negative effects of feedback, especially comparative feedback, and support more consistent benefits from the use of such systems.

A critical need to improve access to the available data, as well as need to tailor its display and interpretation, was identified by injury prevention stakeholders involved in research, policy, and practice. The Canadian Atlas of Child and Youth Injury Prevention ("the Atlas") was developed to address this need. Following a series of iterative consultation meetings and a pilot testing session, the Atlas was scaled up with national data. Two testing sessions were held to evaluate the tools. The Atlas is comprised of three main components: data, indicators, and visualizations. The accessibility of the dashboard is enhanced by customization of data visualizations and data outputs to suit the user's needs. Overall feedback indicated that the tools were easy to use, and that the interface was intuitive and visually appealing. The Canadian Atlas of Child and Youth Injury Prevention provides readily accessible information to injury prevention practitioners, policy makers and researchers, helping to chart pathways to success in improving the child and youth injury prevention system in Canada.

From January 2016 to June 2016, residents were e-mailed a snapshot of their personalized dashboard, a link to the online dashboard, and text summarizing the resident and service utilization averages. We measured resident engagement using e-mail read-receipts and web-based tracking. We also conducted 3 hour-long focus groups with residents. Using grounded theory approach, the transcripts were analyzed for common themes focusing on barriers and facilitators of dashboard use. Among 80 residents, 74% opened the e-mail containing a link to the dashboard and 21% accessed the dashboard itself. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in routine laboratory ordering by dashboard use, although residents who opened the link to the dashboard ordered 0.26 fewer labs per doctor-patient-day than those who did not (95% confidence interval, -0.77 to 0.25; P = 0.31). While they raised several concerns, focus group participants had positive attitudes toward receiving individualized feedback delivered in real time.

CTD2 Dashboard: a searchable web interface to connect validated results from the Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION			English	Article							PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SMALL MOLECULES; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; DEPENDENCIES; MUTATIONS; CYTOSCAPE; RESOURCE; SCALE	The Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Network aims to use functional genomics to accelerate the translation of high-throughput and high-content genomic and small-molecule data towards use in precision oncology. As part of this goal, and to share its conclusions with the research community, the Network developed the 'CTD2 Dashboard' [https://ctd2-dashboard.nci.nih.gov/], which compiles CTD2 Network-generated conclusions, termed 'observations', associated with experimental entities, collected by its member groups ('Centers'). Any researcher interested in learning about a given gene, protein, or compound (a 'subject') studied by the Network can come to the CTD2 Dashboard to quickly and easily find, review, and understand Network-generated experimental results. In particular, the Dashboard allows visitors to connect experiments about the same target, biomarker, etc., carried out by multiple Centers in the Network. The Dashboard's unique knowledge representation allows information to be compiled around a subject, so as to become greater than the sum of the individual contributions. The CTD2 Network has broadly defined levels of validation for evidence ('Tiers') pertaining to a particular finding, and the CTD2 Dashboard uses these Tiers to indicate the extent to which results have been validated. Researchers can use the Network's insights and tools to develop a new hypothesis or confirm existing hypotheses, in turn advancing the findings towards clinical applications.

Informational Dashboards have become the must have accoutrement for Higher Education institutions with various stakeholders jostling for development priority. Due to the time pressure and user demands, the focus of development process is often on designing for each stakeholder and the visual and navigational aspects. Dashboards are designed to make data visually appealing and easy to relate and understand; unfortunately this may mask data issues and create an impression of rigour where it is not justified. This article proposes that the underlying logic behind current dashboard development is limited in the flexibility, scalability, and responsiveness required in the demanding landscape of Big Data and Analytics and explores an alternative approach to data visualisation and sense making. It suggests that the first step required to address these issues is the development of an enriched database which integrates key indicators from various data sources. The database is designed for problem exploration allowing users freedom in navigating between various data-levels, which can then be overlaid with any user interface for dashboard generation for a multitude of stakeholders. Dashboards merely become tools providing users and indication of types of data available for exploration. A Design Research approach is shown, along with a case study to illustrate the benefits, showcasing various views developed for diverse stakeholders employing this approach, specifically the the Digital Decision Network Application (DigitalDNA) employed at Unisa.

Methods: A search was conducted in August, 2016 using the search engine, Google, and key words: 'mobile health blog,' 'telehealth/telemedicine blog,' 'Electronic Health Record blog,' 'personalized health record blog,' 'population health decision support system blog,' and 'public/population health dashboard blog.' The first 24 blogs resulting from each key word search were recorded, generating 144 blogs. A total of 109 unique blogs resulted after removing duplicates and non- functional sites. Results: Blogs with '.com' extensions were most prevalent (72%, n = 79). More than half of the blogs (79%, n = 86) were created by industries. Mobile health (88%, n = 96), telehealth (82%, n = 89), and health IT (78%, n = 85) were the predominant topics covered. Health providers (44%, n = 48), industries (33%, n = 36), patients/consumers (25%, n = 27) and payers/insurance providers (19%, n = 21) constituted the most common target audience. Blogs catering to payers commonly used '.org' extension (n = 10 out of 21), compared to '.com' (n = 7) or '.gov' (n = 2) (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were also observed by topics covered health IT (p = 0.007), subscription (p = 0.048) and LinkedIn social media (p = 0.019) across the website extensions. Conclusions: Further research is needed to examine the use of blogs as channels of communication of best evidence in health informatics research among diverse stakeholders. The role of blogs as policy informatics tools need to be evaluated in order for stakeholders to collaborate, coordinate and share opportunities and challenges of various public health programs and policies.

To monitor immunization-system strengthening in the Polio Eradication Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 (PEESP), the Global Polio Eradication Initiative identified 1 indicator: 10% annual improvement in third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP3) coverage in polio high-risk districts of 10 polio focus countries. Methods. A multiagency team, including staff from the African Region, developed a comprehensive list of outcome and process indicators measuring various aspects of the performance of an immunization system. Results. The development and implementation of the dashboard to assess immunization system performance allowed national program managers to monitor the key immunization indicators and stratify by high-risk and non-high-risk districts. Discussion. Although only a single outcome indicator goal (at least 10% annual increase in DTP3 coverage achieved in 80% of high-risk districts) initially existed in the endgame strategy, we successfully added additional outcome indicators (eg, decreasing the number of DTP3-unvaccinated children) as well as program process indicators focusing on cold chain, stock availability, and vaccination sessions to better describe progress on the pathway to raising immunization coverage. Conclusion. When measuring progress toward improving immunization systems, it is helpful to use a comprehensive approach that allows for measuring multiple dimensions of the system.

Several restrictions prevent from reaching a very high material recycling efficiency: the variability of the composition of new-marketed materials used for packaging production and its shape and complexity are critical issues. The packaging goods are in fact made of different materials (aluminium, polymers, paper, etc.), possibly assembled, having different shape (flat, cylindrical, one-dimensional, etc.), density, colours, optical properties and so on. These aspects limit the effectiveness and efficiency of the sorting and reprocessing plants. The scope of this study was to evaluate the performance of a large scale Material Recovery Facility (MRF) by utilizing data collected during a long period of monitoring. The database resulted from the measured data has been organized in four sections: (1) data related to the amount and type of inlet waste; (2) amount and composition of output products and waste; (3) operating data (such as worked hours for shift, planned and unscheduled maintenance time, setting parameters of the equipment, and energy consumption for shift); (4) economic data (value of each product, disposal price for the produced waste, penalty for non-compliance of products and waste, etc.). A part of this database has been utilized to build an executive dashboard composed by a set of performance indicators suitable to measure the effectiveness and the efficiency of the MRF operations. The dashboard revealed itself as a powerful tool to support managers and engineers in their decisions in respect to the market demand or compliance regulation variation as well as in the designing of the lay-out improvements. The results indicated that the 40% of the input waste was recovered as valuable products and that a large part of these (88%) complied with the standards of the recycling companies. The evaluation of the indicators led to the decision to modify the layout to improve the interception of some polymers for which the performance indicators were poor. In particular, two additional optical sorters have to be inserted to increase the yield indicator and to the overall performance of the facility. Definitely, the results of the work allowed to: increase the yield and purity of products' flows; ensure the compliance of waste flows; increase the workability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

With nearly 1,000 surgeons contributing data from more than 300 centers across North America, the STS GTSD now includes almost a half million cases. In 2016, updated risk models for lung resection and esophagectomy for cancer were reported, and composite quality measures for lobectomy and esophagectomy were developed. Ongoing efforts include upgrading the STS GTSD, establishing public reporting of lobectomy for lung cancer composite scores, creating an on-line dashboard, and strengthening international collaboration with the European Society of Thoracic Surgery Registry. With these initiatives, the STS GTSD aims to continue to improve quality of care and support research endeavors in general thoracic surgery. This article summarizes current aggregate national outcomes in general thoracic surgery and reviews related activities in the areas of quality measurement, performance improvement, and transparency from the STS GTSD during the past 12 months.

End user perceptions of the content and interface of the personalized safety plan screensavers were identified and strategies to overcome the barriers to use for future iterations were defined. Many themes were identified, ranging from appreciation of the clinical decision support provided by the screensavers to the value of the safety-centric content. Differences emerged stemming from each group of end users' role on the care team. All feedback will inform requirements for improvements to the personalized safety plan screensaver.

Dashboards are often composed of different data visualization techniques, amongst which are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which play a crucial role in quickly providing accurate information by comparing current performance against a target required to fulfill business objectives. However, KPIs are not always well known and sometimes it is difficult to find an appropriate KPI to associate with each business objective. In addition, Data Mining techniques are often used when forecasting trends and visualizing data correlations. In this paper we present a new approach to combining these two aspects in order to drive Data Mining techniques to obtain specific KPIs for business objectives in a semi-automated way. The main benefit of our approach is that organizations do not need to rely on existing KPI lists or test KPIs over a cycle as they can analyze their behavior using existing data. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we apply our proposal to the fields of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Data extracted from the University of Alicante in order to identify the KPIs.

This decision is made more complex for large, diverse organizations for which individual sites or components have different requirements and capacities for waste management. For U.S. Army installations, sustainable waste management is a major obstacle for resource constrained and overburdened installation personnel. The Army has prioritized landfill diversion at installations; there is a significant push for each installation to develop and implement waste management plans that follow high-level goals set by U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM). The main objective of this study is to demonstrate an excel based dashboard tool incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for site-specific waste management technology selection. The dashboard uses the preferences of an installation and a series of weighted metrics to evaluate technologies. With this information the dashboard can rank the technologies to identify those that simultaneously meet IMCOM's objectives and are appropriate for specific sites' capabilities and resources. Fourteen different technology makes and models were compared in this version of the decision model including dehydrators, pulpers, garbage disposals, containerized in-vessel composting, windrow composting, forced-air static composting, and containerized anaerobic digestion. MCDA provides for transparent comparison of technologies for all sites, and the dashboard visualizes the level of appropriateness of each technology for each site. The approach developed here adds value in that it utilizes the priorities of the organization and identifies the best performing waste management technology given the specific capacity and capabilities of an individual site.

Cyberinfrastructure for Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						neuroimaging; big data; open science framework; cyberinfrastructure; neuroscience; data sharing; bids; workflow	SPECTRUM DISORDER; DATA CITATION; AUTISM; NEUROSCIENCE; DISCOVERY; SUPPORT; ARCHIVE; PROJECT; ACCESS	Data sharing is becoming more of a requirement as technologies mature and as global research and communications diversify. As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access specialized datasets. In many cases, the realities of data acquisition present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and broadly enriched data exploration. To answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced its commitment to Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens, 2016a,b). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das et al., 2016) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of open data sharing, including: (1) Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (phenotypic, clinical, neuroimaging, biobanking, and genomics, etc.) (2) Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers). (3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data. (4) Configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to High Performance Computing clusters for rapid data processing and sharing of software tools. (5) Robust Workflows and Quality Control mechanisms ensuring transparency and consistency in best practices. (6) Long term storage (and web access) of data, reducing loss of institutional data assets. (7) Enhanced web-based visualization of imaging, genomic, and phenotypic data, allowing for real-time viewing and manipulation of data from anywhere in the world. (8) Numerous modules for data filtering, summary statistics, and personalized and configurable dashboards. Implementing the vision of Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute will be a concerted undertaking that seeks to facilitate data sharing for the global research community. Our goal is to utilize the years of experience in multi-site collaborative research infrastructure to implement the technical requirements to achieve this level of public data sharing in a practical yet robust manner, in support of accelerating scientific discovery.

On top of that, each dashboard is designed in accordance with the user's needs and their observational objectives. Therefore, understanding the context of LA and its users is compulsory as it is part of the dashboard design approach. Our research effort starts with an exploratory study of different contextual elements that could help us define what an adaptive dashboard is and how it fulfills the user's needs. To do so, we have conducted a needs assessment to characterize the user profiles, their activities, their visualization preferences and objectives when using a dedicated dashboard. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual model, which will be used to generate a variety of LA dashboards. Our main goal is to provide users with adaptive dashboards, generated accordingly to their context of use while satisfying the users' requirements. We also discussed the implementation process of our first prototype as well as further improvements.

The importance of these techniques has been recognized in the context of Software Product Lines (SPLs), where the potentially huge number of products makes testing extremely challenging. We found that the open source Drupal framework shares most of the principles and challenges of SPL development and it can be considered a real-world example of family of products. In a previous work, we represented the Drupal configuration space as a feature model and we collected extra functional information about its features from open repositories. Part of this data proved to be a good indicator of faults propensity in Drupal features. Thus, they become valuable assets to prioritize tests in individual Drupal products. In this paper, we present SmarTest, a test prioritization tool for accelerating the detection of faults in Drupal. SmarTest has been developed as an extension of the Drupal core testing system. SmarTest supports the prioritization of tests providing faster feedback and letting testers begin correcting critical faults earlier. Different test prioritization criteria can be selected in SmarTest, such as prioritization based on the number of commits made in the code, or based on the tests that failed in last executions. A customizable dashboard with significant system information to guide the testing is also provided by SmarTest at run-time. This work represents an interesting application of SPL-inspired testing techniques to real-world software systems, which could be applicable to other open-source SPLs.

Using a case from Indonesia, we discuss the challenges of integrating HIS using the concept of attractor for change from the field of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). The dashboard is positioned as such an attractor as a means to get different stakeholders to discuss and reach a consensus on how to integrate and share data without disturbing the underlying systems too much.

This leads us to a design with three modules: the data collection, the search and information processing, and the data presentation. Based on these modules, we present the steps of finding a fitting Open Source technology stack for our concept and discuss pros and cons trough out the process.

When this delivery is done by system, information is usually provided through an executive dashboard. Using executive dashboard, senior leaders can view company's vital information that related to business goal and make a quick decision based on this information. An executive dashboard is the tool to provide such information, however it usually designed with no flexibility so when there is a change in the information report, they will need to call the developer to change it. This research is aimed to design and implement an executive dashboard that provides flexibility, which can be configured by anyone without programming background. This research also proposes a mechanism on how to create an executive dashboard that supports a knowledge discovery capability.

Currently in the dashboard development there have been many methodologies that can be used as a reference. However, the existing methodology does not specify the steps necessary to ensure that the dashboard development is able to accommodate heterogeneous stakeholders, in which each stakeholder has different needs and activities. In ITB central library, there has been adequate data storage method, in the form of database. However, ITB central library does not yet have a dashboard as a medium that can support the use of data by heterogeneous stakeholders. This research aims to develop dashboard of ITB central library for heterogeneous stakeholders. The dashboard is expected to support data utilization by stakeholders, both for analytical and administrative purposes. In this research also conducted a study related to dashboard development methodology, for further modification to show in detail dashboard development steps to accommodate heterogeneous stakeholders. Evaluation of dashboard implementation result is conducted empirically, involving sample from stakeholder of ITB central library. The evaluation uses two existing standardized usability questionnaire, System Usability Scale (SUS) and The Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX). In the evaluation, it is also compiled comments from all evaluation participants to find out how far the dashboard can meet the needs of each stakeholder involved.

Because of its urgencies, it has vulnerabilities and risks that hinder the quality of hospital management. Technological management tools are effective in improving processes and strategic administration because they provide information reliability. The aim of this work is to propose to the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals (FUH's) the use of an open source Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Pentaho, to analyze the Hospital Occupancy Rate (HOR) and support clinical decision making. This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.

If large data-sets are managed poorly inaccurate and biased decision-making may actually be enabled. This paper outlines a process for capturing, organising and analysing a large performance data-set in professional netball. Two hundred and fifty ANZ Championship matches, from the 2012 to 2015 seasons, where analysed. Self-organising maps and a k-means clustering algorithm were used to describe seven game styles, which were used in a case study to devise a strategy for an upcoming opponent. The team implemented a centre-pass (CP) defence strategy based on the opponent's previous successful and unsuccessful performances. This strategy involved allowing the oppositions Wing-attack to receive the CP while allowing their Goal attack to take the second pass. The strategy was monitored live by the coaches on a tablet computer via a custom-built dashboard, which tracks each component of the strategy. The process provides an alternative to use of conventional performance indicators and demonstrates a method for handling large high-dimensional performance data-sets. Further work is needed to identify an ecologically valid method for variable selection.

One of the key issues emerging is the difficulty in the sense-making from the data available. The use of analytic dashboards has been suggested to provide quick insights and distil the large volume of learner interaction data generated. These dashboards hold the promise of providing a contextualized view of data and facilitating useful research exploration. However, little has been done in defining how these dashboards should be created, often resulting in a proliferation of systems for each new research agenda. We present our experience of building MOOC dashboards for two different platforms, namely Coursera and FutureLearn, motivated by a set of design goals with input from a diverse set of stakeholders. We demonstrate the features of the system and how it has served to make data accessible and useable. We report on problems faced, drawing on analyses of think-aloud sessions conducted with real educators, which have informed our dashboard process.

Currently the majority of DR resources are based on commercial loads in which substantial amounts of DR resources for residential purposes are wasted. Despite the multiple advantages of demand response to such residential customers, they are often reluctant to participate in such programs because of privacy concerns or because they are unaware of time-based rates. In this study, a customer dashboard was developed to enhance and persuade customers to participate in demand response programs. The online dashboard was used to increase awareness of all customer types, which is essential for ensuring a significant increase of DR participants. Incorporating flexibility, ease-of-use, and rewards programs will attract customers to use the dashboard thus expanding customer awareness to consciously or subconsciously change energy consumption behaviors.

Model-driven development and design of these dashboards has proven useful in real world scenarios. However, in large organizations, dashboards need to be role-specific, as not all users are concerned by the same data. In this paper, a users-and-roles model is introduced. It extends and adapts the model-driven process monitoring methodology aPo. With this model, it becomes possible to automatically generate user-specific monitoring dashboards, properly displaying the needed information for each user in an organisation. The implementation is evaluated with a real-world use-case from the service industry.

However, PBL is difficult to implement successfully because learners often lack the selfregulation skills required to monitor, reflect, manage and assess their project activities and learning. Furthermore, most learning systems rarely offer possibilities to monitor and reflect on their project and learning processes. Hence, in this paper, we propose a general architecture of project- based learning management system. It enhances learners' reflective processes by supporting them in creating customisable indicators by exploring their traces. We developed an implementation named DDART and conducted an experiment in order to evaluate its usability and perceived utility. We found that this system supports learners to reflect and regulate their activities and learning, even if the indicator creation could be difficult for the novices.

They are mainly used for identifying objects and people based on a combination of tags and readers. Nevertheless, this identification brings out many challenges and concerns including security which still remains an open issue. In this work, we present a survey of recent works dealing with security and privacy in RFID systems. Particularly, we compare and classify them according to which part of RFID system each solution could be applied, taking into account different requirements and parameters including their conformity to RFID standards. Hence, our comparative study targets to provide a wide and clear vision of these concerns as a dashboard to help determining the most appropriate solutions towards any security problem.

For almost all projects, paper-based or at best word processor and spreadsheet reports are manually collected, reviewed, aggregated and archived. The effort and error in this typical process is reduced using a mobile inspection form system that simplifies the field data collection workflow, increases data accuracy and quality, and can be used to generate dynamic project management dashboards. An evaluation of two case study projects provides insight to overcoming technology adoption for pipeline construction as well as performance, quality and forecasting benefits witnessed during these projects. The use of a mobile inspection form system creates the ability for improved analytics such as detailed construction tracking, dynamic forecasting and spatial overlays of construction progress. Improved data standardization and data integrity from the use of tablet forms produces detailed and functional key performance indicators (KPIs) delivered on-demand through a project dashboard. When both field data quality is improved and project managers are provided timely KPIs, projects have the opportunity to be delivered safer, faster and with higher quality, which is a win for the entire pipeline industry.

Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data ismeaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as LearningManagement Systems (LMS) andMassive Open OnlineCourses (MOOCs). The initial search of fivemain academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out ofwhich 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies aswell as various aspects of learning dashboards and theirmaturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines ofwork in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that systematically compare different dashboard designs.

Validation of an automated electronic algorithm and "dashboard" to identify and characterize decompensated heart failure admissions across a medical center	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION; ATHEROSCLEROSIS RISK; NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; HEALTH RECORDS; CARE; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; READMISSION; COMMUNITIES	Background We aim to validate the diagnostic performance of the first fully automatic, electronic heart failure (HF) identification algorithm and evaluate the implementation of an HF Dashboard system with 2 components: real-time identification of decompensated HF admissions and accurate characterization of disease characteristics and medical therapy. Methods We constructed an HF identification algorithm requiring 3 of 4 identifiers: B-type natriuretic peptide >400 pg/mL; admitting HF diagnosis; history of HF International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes; and intravenous diuretic administration. We validated the diagnostic accuracy of the components individually (n = 366) and combined in the HF algorithm (n = 150) compared with a blinded provider panel in 2 separate cohorts. We built an HF Dashboard within the electronic medical record characterizing the disease and medical therapies of HF admissions identified by the HF algorithm. We evaluated the HF Dashboard's performance over 26 months of clinical use. Results Individually, the algorithm components displayed variable sensitivity and specificity, respectively: B-type natriuretic peptide >400 pg/mL (89% and 87%); diuretic (80% and 92%); and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, code (56% and 95%). The HF algorithm achieved a high specificity (95%), positive predictive value (82%), and negative predictive value (85%) but achieved limited sensitivity (56%) secondary to missing provider-generated identification data. The HF Dashboard identified and characterized 3147 HF admissions over 26 months. Conclusions Automated identification and characterization systems can be developed and used with a substantial degree of specificity for the diagnosis of decompensated HF, although sensitivity is limited by clinical data input.

Privacy issues for learning analytics include how personal data are collected and stored as well as how they are analyzed and presented to different stakeholders. A total of 330 university students participated in an exploratory study confronting them with learning analytics systems and associated issues of control over data and sharing of information. Findings indicate that students expect learning analytics systems to include elaborate adaptive and personalized dashboards. Further, students are rather conservative in sharing data for learning analytics systems. On the basis of the relationship between the acceptance and use of learning analytics systems and privacy principles, we conclude that all stakeholders need to be equally involved when learning analytics systems are implemented at higher education institutions. Further empirical research is needed to elucidate the conditions under which students are willing to share relevant data for learning analytics systems.

Countdown 2015 Hlth Syst Policies	Countdown to 2015 country case studies: systematic tools to address the "black box" of health systems and policy assessment	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Policy analysis; Health systems; Reproductive health; Newborn health; Maternal health; Child health; Tanzania; Peru	KANGAROO MOTHER CARE; NEWBORN SURVIVAL; CHILD HEALTH; SCALE-UP; INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; MULTICOUNTRY; BOTTLENECKS; CHALLENGES; PREVENTION	Background: Evaluating health systems and policy (HSP) change and implementation is critical in understanding reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) progress within and across countries. Whilst data for health outcomes, coverage and equity have advanced in the last decade, comparable analyses of HSP changes are lacking. We present a set of novel tools developed by Countdown to 2015 (Countdown) to systematically analyse and describe HSP change for RMNCH indicators, enabling multi-country comparisons. Methods: International experts worked with eight country teams to develop HSP tools via mixed methods. These tools assess RMNCH change over time (e.g. 1990-2015) and include: (i) Policy and Programme Timeline Tool (depicting change according to level of policy); (ii) Health Policy Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing 11 selected RMNCH policies over time); (iii) Health Systems Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing four selected systems indicators over time); and (iv) Programme implementation assessment. To illustrate these tools, we present results from Tanzania and Peru, two of eight Countdown case studies. Results: The Policy and Programme Timeline tool shows that Tanzania's RMNCH environment is complex, with increased funding and programmes for child survival, particularly primary-care implementation. Maternal health was prioritised since mid-1990s, yet with variable programme implementation, mainly targeting facilities. Newborn health only received attention since 2005, yet is rapidly scaling-up interventions at facility-and community-levels. Reproductive health lost momentum, with re-investment since 2010. Contrastingly, Peru moved from standalone to integrated RMNCH programme implementation, combined with multi-sectoral, anti-poverty strategies. The HSP Tracer Indicators Dashboards show that Peru has adopted nine of 11 policy tracer indicators and Tanzania has adopted seven. Peru costed national RMNCH plans pre-2000, whereas Tanzania developed a national RMNCH plan in 2006 but only costed the reproductive health component. Both countries included all lifesaving RMNCH commodities on their essential medicines lists. Peru has twice the health worker density of Tanzania (15.4 vs. 7.1/10,000 population, respectively), although both are below the 22.8 WHO minimum threshold. Conclusions: These are the first HSP tools using mixed methods to systematically analyse and describe RMNCH changes within and across countries, important in informing accelerated progress for ending preventable maternal, newborn and child mortality in the post-2015 era.

The project management processes adopted by the organization were studied together with the theoretical survey to identify a set of indicators. The primary data collection was divided in interviews and questionnaires with managers. The interviews presented indicators resulting in a table of indicators. The questionnaires sought to validate the importance given by the managers to the indicators, to identify the level of coverage and form of presentation, resulting in the hierarchy of the indicators. Finally, the information was analyzed against the theory for the creation of project monitoring dashboards. Among the indicators of the theory, already used by the organization and suggested by the interviewees, eight were chosen to compose the dashboard shaped of two screen models: main, with a summary of the situation of all projects, and secondary, with the detailing of the indicators by project. As contributions the highlight is an identification of need for more in- depth study on rework indicators and lessons learned for R& D organization.

This article seeks to explain this outcome and to contribute to the debate about composite indicators versus a dashboard approach. To this end, it reviews some of the most popular alternatives to GDP (the Human Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Happy Planet Index, and an environmentally corrected GDP), focusing on their conceptual foundations rather than on their statistical consistency as most of the literature does. It is shown that most of these measures are theoretically inconsistent; the exception is the environmentally corrected GDP, but since this too has failed to replace GDP, inconsistency must be only one reason behind the limited use of alternative measures. The author argues that the main reason for GDP's primacy is that GDP is better suited to reflect the goals of capitalist market economies. This implies that constructing composite indicators as alternatives to GDP will be pointless as long as the current preference system has not changed to include environmental or social goals. The author also suggests that for this purpose a dashboard approach, which provides different social groups with intelligible quantitative instruments, may be preferable to the use of composite indicators.

Survey of internal medicine and subspecialty clinicians from March 2014-July 2014 at Saint Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. An information needs assessment was generated from all unique data elements extracted from all handoff and rounding tools used by clinicians in our ICUs and general wards. An electronic survey was distributed to 104 inpatient medical providers. 89 unique data elements were identified from currently utilized handoff and rounding instruments. All data elements were present in our multipurpose ICU-based dashboard. 42 of 104 (40 %) surveys were returned. Data elements important (50/89, 56 %) and unimportant (24/89, 27 %) for routine use were identified. No significant differences in data element ranking were observed between supervisory and nonsupervisory roles. The routine information needs of general ward clinicians are a subset of data elements used routinely by ICU clinicians. Our findings suggest an electronic dashboard could be adapted from the critical care setting to the general wards with minimal modification.

Indeed, 67% (33/49) of AMC ACOs through the Medicare Shared Savings Program through 2014 are believed to include an outside community practice. There are opportunities for both the AMC and the community partners in pursuing such relationships, including possible alignment around shared goals and adding ACO beneficiaries. To create the Johns Hopkins Medicine Alliance for Patients (JMAP), in January 2014, Johns Hopkins Medicine chose to partner with two community primary care groups and one cardiology practice to support clinical integration while adding approximately 60 providers and 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The principal initial interventions within JMAP included care coordination for high-risk beneficiaries and later, in 2014, generating dashboards of ACO quality measures to facilitate quality improvement and early efforts at incorporating clinical pathways and Choosing Wisely recommendations. Additional interventions began in 2015. The principal initial challenges JMAP faced were data integration, generation of quality measure reports among disparate electronic medical records, receiving and then analyzing claims data, and seeking to achieve provider engagement; all these affected timely deployment of the early interventions. JMAP also created three regional advisory councils as a forum promoting engagement of local leadership. Network strategies among AMCs, including adding community practices in a nonemployment model, will continue to require thoughtful strategic planning and a keen understanding of local context.

Metabolic Diet App Suite for inborn errors of amino acid metabolism	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Inherited metabolic diseases; Rare disease; Treatment; Digital technology; Medical nutrition therapy; Diet	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SELF-MANAGEMENT; PHENYLKETONURIA; PERSPECTIVES; ADHERENCE; MHEALTH; PROTEIN	Background: An increasing number of rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to targeted metabolic nutrition therapy. Daily adherence is important to attain metabolic control and prevent organ damage. This is challenging however, given the lack of information of disorder specific nutrient content of foods, the limited availability and cost of specialty products as well as difficulties in reliable calculation and tracking of dietary intake and targets. Objectives: To develop apps for all inborn errors of amino acid metabolism for which the mainstay of treatment is a medical diet and obtain patient and family feedback throughout the process to incorporate this into subsequent versions. Methods&results: The Metabolic Diet App Suite was created with input from health care professionals as a free, user-friendly, online tool for both mobile devices and desktop computers (http://www.metabolicdietapp.org) for 15 different IEMs. General information is provided for each IEM with links to useful online resources. Nutrient information is based on the MetabolicPro (TM), a North American food database compiled by the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI) Technology committee. After user registration, a personalized dashboard and management plan including specific nutrient goals are created. Each Diet App has a user-friendly interface and the functions include: nutrient intake counts, adding your own foods and homemade recipes and, managing a daily food diary. Patient and family feedback was overall positive and specific suggestions were used to further improve the App Suite. Discussion: The Metabolic Diet App Suite aids individuals affected by IEMs to track and plan their meals. Future research should evaluate its impact on patient adherence, metabolic control, quality of life and health-related outcomes. The Suite will be updated and expanded to Apps for other categories of IEMs. Finally, this Suite is a support tool only, and does not replace medical/metabolic nutrition professional advice.

To optimize the use of registers in quality assurance and improvement, data have to be rapidly collected, collated and presented as actionable, at-a-glance information to the reporting departments. This article presents a dashboard performance report on select quality indicators to cancer care providers. Materials and methods: Ten quality indicators registered on an individual patient level in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and recommended by the National Prostate Cancer Guidelines were selected. Data reported to the National Prostate Cancer Register are uploaded within 24 h to the Information Network for Cancer Care platform. Launched in 2014, What''s Going On, Prostate Cancer provides rapid, at-a-glance performance feedback to care providers. Results: The indicators include time to report to the National Prostate Cancer Register, waiting times, designated clinical nurse specialist, multidisciplinary conference, adherence to guidelines for diagnostic work-up and treatment, and documentation and outcome of treatment. For each indicator, three performance levels were defined. Conclusion: What's Going On, a dashboard performance report on 10 selected quality indicators to cancer care providers, provides an example of how data in cancer quality registers can be transformed into condensed, at-a-glance information to be used as actionable metrics for quality assurance and improvement.

They are very important data visualization mechanisms, simple to interpret, easy to deal, and fast on showing pertinent data. Dashboards provide means for reducing time of information analysis, disposing business indicators in quite understandable and attractive interface platforms - a "simple and beautiful" way to support business analysis. However, they use to be static software artifacts having not the ability to evolve, to adapt by themselves to new user needs, tendencies or preferences. In order to provide such abilities, we designed and implemented a personalization system for data visualization platforms. All system's services, ranging from data gathering to data profiling, were developed using a community of autonomous agents with the ability to act together using a private data cloud as a cooperative environment. In this paper we present how the system was conceived, its functional architecture and services, and how agents were implemented, especially the ones related to the personalization of business dashboards.

In these CCs, operators suffer both with information shortage and overload. This paper focuses on the information overload problem. Operators often do not have adequate access to information that may be relevant in the decision-making process. In many CC centers, information is stored without filtering or refinement for later use, and its visualization is pre-defined at design time, offering no possibility of customization. To address the problems created by this lack of support, we propose an architecture to enable fast and easy selection from multiple information sources, and definition of appropriate visualizations. Following this architecture, we developed the "Emergency Dashboard", a system that provides selection of a desired set of data and presents it, using configurable dashboards. We also provide collaborative mechanisms, given that, at times, it is not possible for a single user to handle such large datasets alone.

The heterogeneity and vast amount of sensors, as well as the difficulty of creating interesting sensor data combinations, hinder the deployment of fixed structure dashboards as they are unable to cope with the accordingly vast amount of required mappings. Therefore, in this paper, the development of a dynamic dashboard is presented, able to visualize any particular and user defined data and sensor composition. By implementing the heterogeneous sensors as semantically annotated Web APIs, a dynamic sensor composition and visualization is enabled. The resulting condition monitoring dashboard provides a clear overview of the system KPIs in acceptable timing and provides helpful tools to detect anomalies in system behaviour.

Consequently, monitoring air pollution is currently a critical issue that needs to be addressed for enhancing the well being of citizens. This paper proposes a data analysis engine, based on business intelligence methodologies and open technologies, to support different targeted analysis on air pollution data. To analyse the problem from different facets, air pollution measurements are enriched with additional information such as meteorological and traffic data, which are collected through sensor networks available in the smart city context. This integrated dataset is periodically analyzed to generate informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The informative dashboards can provide useful insights about pollutant concentration at different time granularity levels in the urban areas and support a joint evaluation of pollutant concentrations with climate conditions and traffic flow. As a reference use case, open data on air pollution in the urban area of a major Italian city is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real smart city context.

Scholarship has addressed course attrition once students are enrolled in online courses. However, supporting academic success by assisting students in the making of effective decisions about which online courses to take has received relatively little attention. Students in undergraduate-level online courses from varied disciplines rated the utility of course information types and three course dashboard prototypes. Qualitative feedback was also collected. Various types of information related to the time investment necessary to successfully complete the course were given priority. With regard to information displays, students preferred moderate-to-high amounts of well-organised information, presented with a careful balance of text and visual images. Comments from past students also favoured course dashboard elements.

The dashboard is designed to address the operational needs of air traffic managers in gathering data from multiple sources, thus gaining situational awareness of the NAS status. It monitors several system performance areas in real-time and identifies alerting events, pushing to the user relevant information and notifications regarding evolving problems. ("Pushing" information on a display means autonomous presentation - no query or other interrogation by the user is required.) While high-level system alerts are provided, drill-down information is also available for the user to determine whether further actions are warranted. The dashboard also allows the user to customize the alerts for a specific context by setting thresholds. Field evaluation results suggest that the dashboard capability shortens traffic managers' data acquisition time and, since the dashboard capability is a shared web application, it improves common situational awareness on NAS operations. Ongoing research focuses on calibrating alert thresholds for site-specific needs and expanding the selection of performance metrics enabled by System Wide Information Management feeds.

This paper summarizes the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.

In particular, the right of access allows the data subject to verify if his personal data is processed in a lawful manner. The data controller has the full obligation to provide all information on personal data processing in an easily accessible way. Privacy dashboards are promising tools for this purpose. However, there is not yet any privacy dashboard available which allows full access to all personal data. Particularly, information flows remain unclear. We present the next generation privacy dashboard PrivacyInsight. It provides full access to all personal data along information flows. Additionally, it allows exercising the data subject's further rights. We evaluate PrivacyInsight in comparison with existing approaches by means of a user study. Our results show that PrivacyInsight is the most usable and most feature complete existing privacy dashboard.

But there is a lack of comprehensive analysis solutions for the energy consumption of private households to provide real insights. In order to provide useful information, feedback systems may be the answer. Numerous studies about feedback systems have been conducted so far and each individual component of such a system has been tested. The combination of these components leads to a dashboard for decision support of private households. Within this study the individual components were combined in several configurations and implemented as a prototype dashboard. A Conjoint measurement is used for evaluation and observation of user preferences collected in over 1,000 questionnaires. The result, an evaluated dashboard, combines several effective feedback elements based on user preferences and helps to save energy based on decision support and transparency.

The latter was considered to be the most promising way to ensure the observing flexibility necessary to execute the most demanding scientific programmes under the required, usually very well defined, conditions. Since then new instruments have become operational and 1st generation ones replaced, filling the 12 VLT foci and feeding the VLT Interferometer and its four Auxiliary Telescopes. Operating efficiently such a broad range of instruments installed and available every night of the year on four 8-metre telescopes offers many challenges. Although it may appear that little has changed since 1999, the underlying VLT operational model has evolved in order to accommodate different requirements from the user community and features of new instruments. Did it fulfil its original goal and, if so, how well? How did it evolve? What are the lessons learned after more than 15 years of operations? A careful analysis and monitoring of statistics and trends in Phase 1 and Phase 2 has been deployed under the DOME ( Dashboard for Operational Metrics at ESO) project. The main goal of DOME is to provide robust metrics that can be followed with time in a user-friendly manner. Here, we summarize the main findings on the handling of service mode observations and present the most recent developments.	[Primas, F.; Marteau, S.; Tacconi-Garman, L.

Method: Several articles discussing performance measures of imaging departments were searched for this study. All the related measures were extracted. Then, a panel of imaging experts were asked to rate these measures with an open ended question to seek further potential indicators. A second round was performed to confirm the performance rating. The indicators and their ratings were then reviewed by an executive panel. Based on the final panel's rating, a list of indicators to be used was developed. A team of information technology consultants were asked to determine a set of user interface requirements for the building of the dashboard. In the first round, based on the panel's rating, a list of main features or requirements to be used was determined. Next, Qlikview was utilized to implement the dashboard to visualize a set of selected KPI metrics. Finally, an evaluation of the dashboard was performed. Results: 92 MID indicators were identified. On top of this, 53 main user interface requirements to build of the prototype of dashboard were determined. Then, the project team successfully implemented a prototype of radiology management dashboards into study site. The visual display that was designed was rated highly by users. Conclusion: To develop a dashboard, management of information is essential. It is recommended that a quality map be designed for the MID. It can be used to specify the sequence of activities, their related indicators and required data for calculating these indicators. To achieve both an effective dashboard and a comprehensive view of operations, it is necessary to design a data warehouse for gathering data from a variety of systems. Utilizing interoperability standards for exchanging data among different systems can be also effective in this regard.

Thus the number of bicycles is gradually increasing. The purpose of this paper is to develop a "Smart Enjoy Interact Light (SEIL)" bag utilizing light emitting diode (LED) display and smartphone apps. By transmitting desired information or images with LEDs, a SEIL bag can protect bicyclists, and also allow wearers to communicate with others. Design/methodology/approach - A SEIL built-in bag was developed in the form of a backpack to support all outdoor activities. It can show traffic signals using a wireless controller. Features of design are: ordinary fabric for IT devices; thick and stiff canvas fabric for flexible LEDs; a thin and air-permeable mesh for the LED light; a flexible printed circuit board dashboard for absorbing various shocks; a PVC hard case for the LED display devices; UV coating for waterproofing and durability. Findings - A SEIL bag for bicyclists can be useful in a variety of outdoor sports and in commercial applications as well, such as advertising or displaying products. The detachable part can be utilized as a hip sack or a pouch. Originality/value - A SEIL bag not only protects bicyclists from traffic accidents, but with which they can express information or images in real time. A SEIL bag is interactive fashion item that emphases communication, thus it will contribute to development of smart-wear.

EHDViz: clinical dashboard development using open-source technologies	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						early warning systems; biomedical informatics; data visuzalization; clinical decision systems; clinical dashboard	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; CHOICE RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; EARLY WARNING SCORE; DECISION AID; BIG-DATA; PHYSIOLOGICAL DETERIORATION; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; RISK STRATIFICATION; MEDICAL-RECORD; FOLLOW-UP	Objective To design, develop and prototype clinical dashboards to integrate high-frequency health and wellness data streams using interactive and real-time data visualisation and analytics modalities. Materials and methods We developed a clinical dashboard development framework called electronic healthcare data visualization (EHDViz) toolkit for generating web-based, real-time clinical dashboards for visualising heterogeneous biomedical, healthcare and wellness data. The EHDViz is an extensible toolkit that uses R packages for data management, normalisation and producing high-quality visualisations over the web using R/Shiny web server architecture. We have developed use cases to illustrate utility of EHDViz in different scenarios of clinical and wellness setting as a visualisation aid for improving healthcare delivery. Results Using EHDViz, we prototyped clinical dashboards to demonstrate the contextual versatility of EHDViz toolkit. An outpatient cohort was used to visualise population health management tasks (n=14221), and an inpatient cohort was used to visualise real-time acuity risk in a clinical unit (n=445), and a quantified-self example using wellness data from a fitness activity monitor worn by a single individual was also discussed (n-of-1). The back-end system retrieves relevant data from data source, populates the main panel of the application and integrates user-defined data features in real-time and renders output using modern web browsers. The visualisation elements can be customised using health features, disease names, procedure names or medical codes to populate the visualisations. The source code of EHDViz and various prototypes developed using EHDViz are available in the public domain at http://ehdviz.dudleylab.org. Conclusions Collaborative data visualisations, wellness trend predictions, risk estimation, proactive acuity status monitoring and knowledge of complex disease indicators are essential components of implementing data-driven precision medicine. As an open-source visualisation framework capable of integrating health assessment, EHDViz aims to be a valuable toolkit for rapid design, development and implementation of scalable clinical data visualisation dashboards.

Design and feasibility of integrating personalized PRO dashboards into prostate cancer care	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						patient-reported outcomes; patient-provider communication; patient-centered care; user-computer interface; data display	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; ROUTINE PRACTICE; CLINICAL CARE; INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; SATISFACTION	Objective Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a valued source of health information, but prior work focuses largely on data capture without guidance on visual displays that promote effective PRO use in patient-centered care. We engaged patients, providers, and design experts in human-centered design of "PRO dashboards" that illustrate trends in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reported by patients following prostate cancer treatment. Materials and Methods We designed and assessed the feasibility of integrating dashboards into care in 3 steps: (1) capture PRO needs of patients and providers through focus groups and interviews; (2) iteratively build and refine a prototype dashboard; and (3) pilot test dashboards with patients and their provider during follow-up care. Results Focus groups (n = 60 patients) prioritized needs for dashboards that compared longitudinal trends in patients' HRQOL with "men like me." Of the candidate dashboard designs, 50 patients and 50 providers rated pictographs less helpful than bar charts, line graphs, or tables (P<.001) and preferred bar charts and line graphs most. Given these needs and the design recommendations from our Patient Advisory Board (n = 7) and design experts (n = 7), we built and refined a prototype that charts patients' HRQOL compared with age-and treatment-matched patients in personalized dashboards. Pilot testing dashboard use (n = 12 patients) improved compliance with quality indicators for prostate cancer care (P<.01). Conclusion PRO dashboards are a promising approach for integrating patient-generated data into prostate cancer care. Informed by human-centered design principles, this work establishes guidance on dashboard content, tailoring, and clinical use that patients and providers find meaningful.

Rather than providing direct actionable instructions, we target to present health data in such a way that the users infer their health status and create their own actions from the data itself. User interviews revealed a wide range of potential challenges with the adoption of personal health dashboards in general. Features that enabled a single view to health data from multiple sources and the comparison of trends in different parameters over the long term were highlighted as desirable.

These systems generate a lot of data but fail to effectively convert these data into actionable information for decision makers. Such ineffectiveness often is attributed to a lack of alignment between strategic planning and information technology (TT) initiatives supporting operational goals. We present a case study that illustrates how the use of digital dashboards at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland (SJMO) Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, was instrumental in supporting such an alignment. Driven by a focus on key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboard applications also led to other tangible and intangible benefits. An ability to track KPIs over time and against established targets, with drill-down capabilities, allowed leadership to hold staff members accountable for achieving their performance targets. By displaying the dashboards in prominent locations (such as operational unit floors, the physicians' cafeteria, and nursing stations), SJMO ushered in transparency in the planning and monitoring processes. The need to develop KPI metrics and drive data collection efforts became ingrained in the work ethos of people at every level of the organization. Although IT-enabled dashboards have been instrumental in supporting this cultural transformation, the focus of investment was the ability of technology to make collective vision and action the responsibility of all stakeholders.

We have followed the strategy of analog genomics projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), which provides a vast amount of data on human cell lines experiments. The dashboard includes results of shotgun and selected reaction monitoring proteomics experiments, post-translational modifications information, as well as proteogenomics studies. We have also processed the transcriptomics data from the ENCODE and Human Body Map (HBM) projects for the identification of specific gene expression patterns in different cell lines and tissues, taking special interest in those genes having little proteomic evidence available (missing proteins). Peptide databases have been built using single nucleotide variants and novel junctions derived from RNA-Seq data that can be used in search engines for sample-specific protein identifications on the same cell lines or tissues. The dasHPPboard has been designed as a tool that can be used to share and visualize a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic data, providing at the same time easy access to resources for proteogenomics analyses.

Development of an operational reporting dashboard designed to correlate data from multiple sources to help detect potential drug diversion by automated dispensing cabinet (ADC) users is described. Methods. A commercial business intelligence platform was used to create a dashboard tool for rapid detection of unusual patterns of ADC transactions by anesthesia service providers at a large pediatric hospital. By linking information from the hospital's pharmacy information management system (PIMS) and anesthesia information management system (AIMS) in an associative data model, the "narcotic reconciliation dashboard" can generate various reports to help spot outlier activity associated with ADC dispensing of controlled substances and documentation of medication waste processing. Results. The dashboard's utility was evaluated by "back-testing" the program with historical data on an actual episode of diversion by an anesthesia provider that had not been detected through traditional methods of PIMS and AIMS data monitoring. Dashboard-generated reports on key metrics (e.g., ADC transaction counts, discrepancies in dispensed versus reconciled amounts of narcotics, PIMS AIMS documentation mismatches) over various time frames during the period of known diversion clearly indicated the diverter's outlier status relative to other authorized ADC users. Conclusion. A dashboard program for correlating ADC transaction data with pharmacy and patient care data may be an effective tool for detecting patterns of ADC use that suggest drug diversion.

Service oriented Architecture (SoA) is one of most successful paradigms deployed over the Cloud; is a layered architecture to organize software resources as services and to facilitate their deployment, discovery, and combination to produce new services. The coordination of innovations carried out between these services is a key challenge of SoA, as any failings in such services could result in a lack of availability, which may violate Service Level Agreements, leading to financial penalties or customer dissatisfaction. A service known as the Protocol service can be introduced and integrated within a system to coordinate innovations. This service may then be linked with a service called the Access Control Policies (AC_Policies) service, which identifies permissions of invocation of the Protocol service. Next, a real-time Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) dashboard is automatically generated to supervise the process of assigning the Access Control Policies, along with the status of the executions of Web services. This approach is achieved by harnessing the capability of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) to facilitate the automatic generation of services. As a proof of concept, this approach is implemented as a plugin.

Visual dashboards and templates make it easy to get started, but asking more sophisticated questions often requires learning a tool designed for expert analysts. Natural language interaction allows users to ask questions directly in complex programs without having to learn how to use an interface. However, natural language is often ambiguous. In this work we propose a mixed-initiative approach to managing ambiguity in natural language interfaces for data visualization. We model ambiguity throughout the process of turning a natural language query into a visualization and use algorithmic disambiguation coupled with interactive ambiguity widgets. These widgets allow the user to resolve ambiguities by surfacing system decisions at the point where the ambiguity matters. Corrections are stored as constraints and influence subsequent queries.

To address non-emergency issues municipalities commonly acquire citizens' reports and then analyze them offline to perform targeted actions. However, since non-emergency data potentially scale towards Big Data there is a need for open standards and technologies to enable data mining and Business Intelligence analyses. The paper presents an integrated data mining and Business Intelligence architecture, relying on open technologies, for the analysis of non-emergency open data acquired in a Smart City context. Non-emergency data are first enriched with additional information related to the context of the warning reports and then analyzed offline to generate (i) informative dashboards based on a selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and (iii) association rules representing implications between warning categories and contextual information (e.g., city areas, districts, time slots). KPIs and rules are exploited to selectively notify to municipality actors (assessors, area operators) potentially critical situations, according to their role and authority. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real Smart City context.

Analyzing social streams in real-time for personalization and recommendation purpose have become important topics in the data management community. In this paper, we propose MYSTREAM, a personalization service to follow events from Twitter. To improve the scalability of the service, MYSTREAM adopts an in-browser and hybrid architecture. MYSTREAM leverages the device of users to perform the computational operations on the users' browser, while the server only provides all the necessary material to perform these tasks. In addition, MYSTREAM adopts a stream-based processing approach to identify the relevant contents in a real-time manner. Moreover, the recommendation engine of MYSTREAM is highly modular. Users can build a personalized dashboard by assembling the recommendation modules they prefer to follow the considered event. We implemented and evaluated MYSTREAM using real trace from Twitter. We show that MYSTREAM is effective to follow an event from Twitter, particularly the live recommendation module quickly identifies the most valuable contents over time. In a system perspective, we show that the cost running MYSTREAM on the client device remains minimal.

The globally recognized need to manage and improve the efficiency of our use of electricity, and the need in most jurisdictions to increase the integration and utilization of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, provides a strong motivation for individuals to be aware of their electricity consumption in real-time, and to manage that consumption according to need (imperative, background or discretionary activities) and availability of energy. This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a dashboard-like display, implemented on a mobile platform (phone or tablet), which provides both an instant overview and awareness of consumption and availability, and facility to drill down to determine detail, and potentially to control individual appliances.

However, as the integration cycles become shorter, the amount of data increases, and the effort to find information in CI environments becomes substantial. In modern CI environments, the selection of measurements (e.g., build status, quality metrics) listed in a dashboard does only change with the intervention of a stakeholder (e.g., a project manager). In this paper, we want to address the shortcoming of static views with so-called Software Quality Assessment (SQA) profiles. SQA-Profiles are defined as rule-sets and enable a dynamic composition of CI dashboards based on stakeholder activities in tools of a CI environment (e.g., version control system). We present a set of SQA-Profiles for project management committee (PMC) members: Bandleader, Integrator, Gatekeeper, and Onlooker. For this, we mined the commit and issue management activities of PMC members from 20 Apache projects. We implemented a framework to evaluate the performance of our rule-based SQA-Profiles in comparison to a machine learning approach. The results showed that project-independent SQA-Profiles can be used to automatically extract the profiles of PMC members with a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 0.78.

Dashboards are often composed by different data visualization techniques, amongst which Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) play a crucial role in facilitating quick and precise information by comparing current performance against a target required to fulfill business objectives. It is however the case that not always KPIs are well known, and sometimes it is difficult to find an adequate KPI to associate with each business objective. On the other hand, data mining techniques are often used for forecasting trends and visualizing data correlations. In this paper, we present a novel approach to combine these two aspects in order to drive data mining techniques into obtaining specific KPIs for business objectives in a semi-automatic way. The main benefit of our approach, is that organizations do not need to rely on existing KPI lists, such as APQC, nor test KPIs on a cycle, as they can analyze their behaviour using existing data. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we apply our proposal to the novel field of MOOC courses in order to identify additional KPIs to the ones being currently used.

Insights from text analytics are conventionally presented as visualizations and dashboards to the analyst. While these insights are intended to be set up as a one-time task and observed in a passive manner, most use cases in the real world require constant tweaking of these dashboards in order to adapt to new data analysis settings. Current systems supporting such analysis have grown from simplistic chains of aggregations to complex pipelines with a range of implicit (or latent) and explicit parametric knobs. The re-execution of such pipelines can be computationally expensive, and the increased query-response time at each step may significantly delay the analysis task. Enabling the analyst to interactively tweak and explore the space allows the analyst to get a better hold on the data and insights. We propose a novel interactive framework that allows social media analysts to tweak the text mining dashboards not just during its development stage, but also during the analytics process itself. Our framework leverages opportunities unique to text pipelines to ensure fast response times, allowing for a smooth, rich and usable exploration of an entire analytics space.

In this article, Roy Pearson resurrects the PRD to depict the degree to which a method correctly forecasts the direction of change. Roy extends the PRD to provide a more comprehensive picture of forecasting performance. Theil's original PRD compared forecasts with the actual changes that were realized. His diagram emphasizes an element of accuracy that is not accounted for in traditional metricsthe accuracy with which you forecast the correct direction of change. Roy expands on the original diagram to incorporate evaluation of whether the forecasts are improvements on the standard benchmark of naive (no-change) forecasts. A PRD is a good complement to measures of error size, such as MAPE. The PRD of your forecasts quickly shows if you've got the direction of change right, if you've overestimated or underestimated the changes, and if your forecasts were better than no-change predictions. Also, seeing a plot of all of the outcomes reveals patterns in your errors, providing insights about what you can do to improve your accuracy and credibility. Pearson suggests adding a table summarizing the forecast error distribution and quantifying the patterns shown in the diagram. He also points out that while the PRD is a useful addition to the forecaster's personal accuracy dashboard, you may not want to include it in forecast reports to management. The reason: A naive (no-change) forecast beats most forecasters more often than we'd expect. Management may soon realize that such forecasts are much cheaper to produce than ours.									5	0	0	0	0	JOHN WILEY & SONS	CHICHESTER	THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX PO  19 8SQ, ENGLAND			978-1-119-22829-5; 978-1-119-22456-3				2015							228	237			10.1002/9781119244592			10	Business, Finance; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods	Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences	BL1LA	WOS:000447823000036					2019-01-22	J	Balkan, S; Demirkan, H				Balkan, Sule; Demirkan, Haluk			Teaching Predictive Model Management in MIS Classrooms: A Tutorial	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Business Intelligence; Business Analytics; Predictive Modeling		Analytics has become a key element of the business decision process over the last decade. In today's competitive business world, organizations have found out that their data and how they use it can make them much more competitive. According to many research institutions (e.g., Gartner and McKinsey), the worldwide market for business analytics solutions in practice, research, and education is growing exponentially. As the use of analytics become widespread, business school graduates need to gain the necessary knowledge and skill sets to use these assets effectively. In the spirit of analytical thinking, we developed a practice-oriented business case that uses a sample scenario, managerial dashboards, betting templates, model repository and model performance management metrics that teaches predictive analytics concepts and decision making with incomplete information intended for MIS courses. Through exercises and interactions, students gain the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to be become effective decision makers through applying analytical thinking.

The Internet is full of public communication in an unstructured form and reflects recent movements of contributors' perception of the company, brand, products, competitors or whole market. As one of the approaches to achieve a better view we propose to design metrics which should be followed in order to get valuable insight where the company stands in terms of its customers. This paper focuses on obtaining an e-Word-of-Mouth in the banking sector using publicly available data. The main goal is to design metrics and dashboards evaluating customers' perception of a bank's services based on the analysis of public Facebook sites and web discussions related to several banks in the Czech Republic. We studied several approaches to unstructured data analysis. Thus we present complementary findings in classification of the unstructured data analysis presentation as a set of summarised metadata, top peaks of primary qualitative data and results of automated semantic analysis of the unstructured data. Based on the result we discuss the possible value of an unstructured data analysis and related systems. We find out that the value could be in the identification of opportunities and threats in the market by unexpected movements in public opinion of the Internet crowd, which we suggest to explore in future research. The benefit of this report is to describe the processing of data that can be obtained with emphasis on their content, their further enrichment, and their users.

To use performance data effectively, nurses need to understand how to interpret and use data in meaningful ways to guide practice. Dashboards are interactive computerised tools that display performance data. In one large, urban teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada, unit-specific dashboards were implemented across the organisation. Methods A qualitative study was undertaken to explore the perceptions and experiences of frontline nurses and managers associated with the implementation of a unit-level dashboard. Six units were selected to participate in the study. Data were analysed using a directed content analysis approach. Results The sample included 56 study participants, including 51 front-line nurses and 5 unit managers. Three key themes emerged around nurses' and unit managers' perspectives on the implementation of unit-specific dashboards. Nurses and managers described that the Care Utilising Evidence dashboard was a visual tool that displayed data on the impact of the nursing care provided to patients. This tool also was used by the nurses and managers to keep track of processes of care and patient outcomes and experiences at a unit level. Further, nurses were able to use performance data to identify quality care improvements specific to their unit. Conclusions The results highlight how unit-specific dashboards are being used to monitor performance and drive quality improvement efforts from the perspectives of nurses and unit managers. In practice, nurse leaders may consider investing in dashboards as a quality improvement strategy to optimise the use of performance data at their organisations.

This paper provokes the question of whether open-source virtual environments can indeed provide the appropriate venue to do so, leveraging application programming interfaces and a modular approach to packaging the overall framework that encourages the progressive integration of data, tools and models from the community. This paper presents one opportunity: a virtual environment called CyberEye and the cyberinfrastructure that backs this collaboration space, providing users with a customizable dashboard where they can annotate, mark up and share information with other authorized users through a web-based geospatial environment. The paper focuses on the platform's two distinct workflows: Rapid Risk Assessment and Data Intake and Discovery, providing for each working User Scenarios to demonstrate the platform capabilities, relative to the current standard of practice.

Novel approaches to overcome logistic obstacles and increase efficiencies of learning, behavior modification, and exercise surveillance may increase CR participation. In an observational study, the feasibility and utility of a mobile smartphone application for CR, Heart Coach (HC), were assessed as part of standard care. Ultimately, innovative CR models incorporating HC may facilitate better CR usage and value. METHODS: Twenty-six patients enrolled in CR installed HC. Over the next 30 days, they were prompted by HC to complete a daily "task list" that included medications, walking, education (text and videos), and surveys. Cardiac rehabilitation providers monitored each patient's progress through a HC-based Web dashboard and also sent them personalized feedback and support. Completion of the tasks and feedback (qualitative and quantitative) from patients and clinicians were tracked. RESULTS: Patients engaged with HC 90% of days during the study period, with uniformly favorable impact on compliance and adherence. Eighty-three percent of patients reported a positive/very positive HC experience. Providers reported that HC enhanced their provision of therapy by improving communication, clinical insight, patient participation, and program efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating a mobile care delivery platform into CR was feasible, safe, and agreeable to patients and clinicians. It enhanced patient perceptions of CR care and physician perceptions of the CR caregiving process. Mobile-enabled technologies hold promise to extend the quality and reach of CR, and to better achieve contemporary accountable care goals.

Ideally, an organizational IT service is valuable for both the providers and users of systems and solutions. However, mutually beneficial outcomes may be difficult to achieve within the configurations through which IT services are delivered. We suggest that analyzing stakeholder interplay in IT service processes helps us to understand how information systems (IS) organizations can be leveraged to co-create business value. Through a qualitative empirical inquiry, we explore IT service realization in two case organizations. Through our analysis we find that value creation builds on orchestrated social action among. the different stakeholder groups involved. Joint value creation in IT service processes hence calls for specific network leadership and resource integration capabilities, from the IS organization. The paper enriches the current understanding of business value creation in IT services by infusing the service logic with traditional IT management perspectives. The findings highlight that the extent to which the IS organization can learn to facilitate the interaction between the essential actors in an 'IT service system' and leverage user-perceived value throughout the service process will ultimately determine its success or failure.

Adaptation and implementation of local maternity dashboards in a Zimbabwean hospital to drive clinical improvement	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article								Problem The Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health of the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that national health outcome data were often of questionable quality and "not timely enough for practical use by health planners and administrators". Delayed reporting of poor-quality data limits the ability of front-line staff to identify problems rapidly and make improvements. Approach Clinical "dashboards" based on locally available data offer a way of providing accurate and timely information. A dashboard is a simple computerized tool that presents a health facility's clinical data graphically using a traffic-light coding system to alert front-line staff about changes in the frequency of clinical outcomes. It provides rapid feedback on local outcomes in an accessible form and enables problems to be detected early. Until now, dashboards have been used only in high-resource settings. Local setting An overview maternity dashboard and a maternal mortality dashboard were designed for, and introduced at, a public hospital in Zimbabwe. A midwife at the hospital was trained to collect and input data monthly. Relevant changes. Implementation of the maternity dashboards was feasible and 28 months of clinical outcome data were summarized using common computer software. Presentation of these data to staff led to the rapid identification of adverse trends in outcomes and to suggestions for actions to improve health-care quality. Lessons learnt Implementation of maternity dashboards was feasible in a low-resource setting and resulted in actions that improved health-care quality locally. Active participation of hospital management and midwifery staff was crucial to their success.

They require for rapid responses while fulfilling customer needs and mix ordered active note to serve customer preferences. Such requirement needs a real time mission-critical business intelligence which ensures effectiveness and efficiency on fulfilling customer need. In this paper, the objectives are to acquire and to formulate customer preference requirement on aromatherapy product in real time mode. Main characteristics are on key performance indicators (KPI) and displayed them for evaluation in form of dashboard. The formulation worked with sort of databases which filled by customer interaction in real time mode to determine best aromatherapy personal mixture by using quantification theory type 1 (QTT-1) method. QTT-1 is an effective analysis method for building a mathematical model of the relationships between customer personality type and aromatherapy mixture compositions. Dashboard generated from KPI ease the decision making on each element in business intelligence. Further personality approaches are needed to cover each specific requirement on different group of customers.

In order to qualify decision makers to understand the fundamental principles of quality management in production networks, a game-based simulation and learning environment is developed, which can furthermore be used to understand how human factors influence the quality of decisions in complex production networks. Previous studies have shown that underlying factors must exist, which predict the players' performance. It is currently unexplored, which factors are contributing to high performance. To deeper investigate which human factors are critical for supply chain success and to further refine the quality management game a series of studies were examined. As expected, expertise had a great impact on performance, however contrary to the expectations cognitive skills had none. The refined decision dashboard, with seamlessly integrated self-adapting visualizations on key performance indicators, had a significant positive impact on game performance. The studies suggest that the developed game is a valuable contribution for the qualification of quality managers, as the quality of decision increased. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However metacognitive strategies argue that learners can improve their learning performances by monitoring their activities, especially in the context of Project-Based Learning (PBL). Our work consists in designing tools to support metacognitive strategies. In this paper, a framework and a dynamic dashboard for PBL situations are proposed to help learners to collect, analyze and visualize the meaningful traces of their activities by themselves. The proposed framework integrates activity traces (interactions with the LMS) and reporting traces (semi-structured sentences written by the learners). The dynamic dashboard supports learners in the creation customizable indicators through a user-friendly interface.

Surrounding dynamic environment requires high quality planning, fast responses on frequent changes as well as sophisticated development of own resources. The new generation of interactive, dynamic, knowledge-based tools forms a promising platform not only for performance management, but also for continuously optimal utilization of resources and early detection of crises. The idea of multimodal management (MM) comes from the control engineering, where instead of a single controller; different algorithms are applied for various operational modes. The analogy with management is straightforward. If firm operates in a quiet market (without high dynamic), it does not require so many specific control actions and evolves smoothly towards the predefined performance goals. On the other hand, turbulent, highly competitive surrounding conditions framework requires qualitatively different managerial activities. In the full paper we will show, that the proposed concept of modality is closely related to company lifecycle stage, risk relations of its managers or adopted competitive strategy. MM concept is implemented as a dynamic Balanced Scorecard (dBSC) architecture, extended with adaptive, interactive managerial dashboard. Its main innovativeness consist on the presence of MFE - a promising tool for recommendation of the most productive but still safe decisions with respect to particular external and internal preferences. For example, young, small and growing companies, applying the high-customization strategy in a very competitive market must employ different managerial patterns than the subsidies of global companies, selling a similar product. The proposed MM framework helps firms to maximize their performance safely and fully in accordance with internal policies. Consequently, it also indicates the need for structural changes in cases, when the planed outputs cannot be achieved parametrically.

While there is a trend followed by the providers of workflow engines to ease the creation of workflows tailored to their specific workflow system, the management tools still often necessitate much understanding of the workflow concepts and languages. This paper describes the approach targeting various workflow systems and building a single user interface for editing and monitoring workflows under consideration of aspects such as optimization and provenance of data. The design allots agile Web frameworks and novel technologies to build a workflow dashboard offered in a web browser and connecting seamlessly to available workflow systems and external resources like Cloud infrastructures. The user interface eliminates the need to become acquainted with diverse layouts. Thus, the usability is immensely increased for various aspects of managing workflows.

Unfortunately, developers sometimes feel frustrated when they cannot easily obtain the particular information they need for a given task; furthermore, the constant in flux of new data - the vast majority of which is irrelevant to their task at hand - may result in issues being "dropped on the floor". In this paper, we present a developer-centric approach to issue tracking that aims to reduce information overload and improve developers' situational awareness. Our approach is motivated by a grounded theory study of developer comments, which suggests that customized views of a project's repositories that are tailored to developer-speci fi c tasks can help developers better track their progress and understand the surrounding technical context. From the qualitative study, we uncovered a model of the kinds of information elements that are essential for developers in completing their daily tasks, and from this model we built a tool organized around customized issue-tracking dashboards. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that this dashboard-like approach to issue tracking can reduce the volume of irrelevant emails by over 99% and also improve support for speci fi c issue-tracking tasks.

The UMass Amherst Libraries uses the business intelligence software Tableau to help selectors more clearly see the connection between monograph purchases and circulation data. Using dashboards, subject selectors can see the impact of monograph selections within a discipline, across the collection, and over a period of time. Graphic visualizations are easier to understand than previously used text and numerical based spreadsheets for data analysis and facilitate exploration at different levels. This paper discusses how data visualizations are used to effectively communicate monograph purchasing, circulation, and expenditures. Interactive dashboards help transform abstract ideas into a solid holistic understanding of the collections and in turn provide a common language to facilitate collection development discussions, decisions, and policies.

We have developed techniques to facilitate information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for major disaster recovery planning and management. We have designed and implemented two parallel systems: a web-based prototype of a Business Continuity Information Network system and an All-Hazard Disaster Situation Browser system that run on mobile devices. Data mining and information retrieval techniques help impacted communities better understand the current disaster situation and how the community is recovering. Specifically, information extraction integrates the input data from different sources; report summarization techniques generate brief reviews from a large collection of reports at different granularities; probabilistic models support dynamically generating query forms and information dashboard based on user feedback; and community generation and user recommendation techniques are adapted to help users identify potential contacts for report sharing and community organization. User studies with more than 200 participants from EOC personnel and companies demonstrate that our systems are very useful to gain insights about the disaster situation and for making decisions.

Hospitalization and surgery in older patients often leads to a loss of strength, mobility, and functional capacity. We tested the hypothesis that wireless accelerometry could be used to measure mobility during hospital recovery after cardiac surgery. Description. We used an off-the-shelf fitness monitor to measure daily mobility in patients after surgery. Data were transmitted wirelessly, aggregated, and configured onto a provider-viewable dashboard. Evaluation. Wireless monitoring of mobility after major surgery was easy and practical. There was a significant relationship between the number of steps taken in the early recovery period, length of stay, and dismissal disposition. Conclusions. Wireless monitoring of mobility after major surgery creates an opportunity for early identification and intervention in individual patients and could serve as a tool to evaluate and improve the process of care and to affect postdischarge outcomes.

Effects of a computerized feedback intervention on safety performance by junior doctors: results from a randomized mixed method study	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Patient safety; Clinical decision support; Junior doctors	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PRESCRIBING ERROR; IMPROVEMENT; OUTCOMES; AUDIT; MODEL; CARE	Background: The behaviour of doctors and their responses to warnings can inform the effective design of Clinical Decision Support Systems. We used data from a University hospital electronic prescribing and laboratory reporting system with hierarchical warnings and alerts to explore junior doctors' behaviour. The objective of this trial was to establish whether a Junior Doctor Dashboard providing feedback on prescription warning information and laboratory alerting acceptance rates was effective in changing junior doctors' behaviour. Methods: A mixed methods approach was employed which included a parallel group randomised controlled trial, and individual and focus group interviews. Junior doctors below the specialty trainee level 3 grade were recruited and randomised to two groups. Every doctor (N = 42) in the intervention group was e-mailed a link to a personal dashboard every week for 4 months. Nineteen participated in interviews. The 44 control doctors did not receive any automated feedback. The outcome measures were the difference in responses to prescribing warnings (of two severities) and laboratory alerting (of two severities) between the months before and the months during the intervention, analysed as the difference in performance between the intervention and the control groups. Results: No significant differences were observed in the rates of generating prescription warnings, or in the acceptance of laboratory alarms. However, responses to laboratory alerts differed between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. For the doctors of Foundation Year 1 grade, this improvement was significantly (p = 0.002) greater in the group with access to the dashboard (53.6% ignored pre-intervention compared to 29.2% post intervention) than in the control group (47.9% ignored pre-intervention compared to 47.0% post intervention). Qualitative interview data indicated that while junior doctors were positive about the electronic prescribing functions, they were discriminating in the way they responded to other alerts and warnings given that from their perspective these were not always immediately clinically relevant or within the scope of their responsibility. Conclusions: We have only been able to provide weak evidence that a clinical dashboard providing individualized feedback data has the potential to improve safety behaviour and only in one of several domains. The construction of metrics used in clinical dashboards must take account of actual work processes.

But if we have few effective control variables across this service deployment, the hidden distortions or defects of the system might threaten the lives and rights of the stakeholders. Therefore we need to increase the service credibility, to get WBAN effective. This study proposes a governance mechanism using feasible variables that are currently in use in practices in WBAN environments against medical incidents. Control variables were tested in Seoul National University hospital and related medical industries of South Korea. We assume that WBAN systems would be open based on integrating patients, medical employees and law enforcements to get smart theater operations against medical incidents by implementing proposed MJA(Multilateral Joint Analysis) model. MJA model also contributes to the convergence of computer systems and medical services by demonstrating flexible SOA(Service Oriented Architecture) dashboard of healthcare services with credibility factors in medicine. The important components in MJA model across WBAN, were found to be "Safety, Accuracy and Reliability" in priority order. Factor analysis, correlations and ANOVA were used to evaluate this model and an IT dashboard with a realization of mobile application, was used to support participants' decision-making.

Development and initial evaluation of a treatment decision dashboard	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE DECISIONS; QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; PERCEPTUAL FLUENCY; JUDGMENTS; QUALITY; FORMATS; DESIGN; TABLES	Background: For many healthcare decisions, multiple alternatives are available with different combinations of advantages and disadvantages across several important dimensions. The complexity of current healthcare decisions thus presents a significant barrier to informed decision making, a key element of patient-centered care. Interactive decision dashboards were developed to facilitate decision making in Management, a field marked by similarly complicated choices. These dashboards utilize data visualization techniques to reduce the cognitive effort needed to evaluate decision alternatives and a non-linear flow of information that enables users to review information in a self-directed fashion. Theoretically, both of these features should facilitate informed decision making by increasing user engagement with and understanding of the decision at hand. We sought to determine if the interactive decision dashboard format can be successfully adapted to create a clinically realistic prototype patient decision aid suitable for further evaluation and refinement. Methods: We created a computerized, interactive clinical decision dashboard and performed a pilot test of its clinical feasibility and acceptability using a multi-method analysis. The dashboard summarized information about the effectiveness, risks of side effects and drug-drug interactions, out-of-pocket costs, and ease of use of nine analgesic treatment options for knee osteoarthritis. Outcome evaluations included observations of how study participants utilized the dashboard, questionnaires to assess usability, acceptability, and decisional conflict, and an open-ended qualitative analysis. Results: The study sample consisted of 25 volunteers 7 men and 18 women with an average age of 51 years. The mean time spent interacting with the dashboard was 4.6 minutes. Mean evaluation scores on scales ranging from 1 (low) to 7 (high) were: mechanical ease of use 6.1, cognitive ease of use 6.2, emotional difficulty 2.7, decision-aiding effectiveness 5.9, clarification of values 6.5, reduction in decisional uncertainty 6.1, and provision of decision-related information 6.0. Qualitative findings were similarly positive. Conclusions: Interactive decision dashboards can be adapted for clinical use and have the potential to foster informed decision making. Additional research is warranted to more rigorously test the effectiveness and efficiency of patient decision dashboards for supporting informed decision making and other aspects of patient-centered care, including shared decision making.

Utilization of Dashboard Technology in Academic Radiology Departments: Results of a National Survey	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Dashboard; academic radiology; productivity; financial; key performance indicators	INFORMATION; SYSTEM; TOOL; WEB	Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the most widely used financial, productivity, and accessibility metrics used by academic radiology departments (ARDs) in a dashboard format via a national survey. The results provide a guide to the selection of preferred or commonly used indicators to facilitate dashboard implementation and use. Methods: The study met the criteria for an exemption from institutional review board approval. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a survey approved by the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments and sent to its members. The survey was designed to evaluate the adoption, access, and composition of dashboard technology in ARDs, particularly those related to measures of productivity and financial performance. Results: The overall response rate was 42% (56 of 131 members). Sixty-two percent of responding ARDs currently use some form of dashboard technology, but 50% have used this technology for <= 2 years. Sixty-five percent of all ARDs use their dashboard information on a monthly basis. The two dashboard financial indicators most frequently used by ARDs are revenue and actual expenses. Similarly, the two productivity indicators used most widely are total examination volume and examination volume per modality. The two most important access indicators used are report turnaround time and backlog per unit time. Conclusions: Currently, fewer than two-thirds of the responding ARDs use dashboard technology, and one-half have used the technology for <= 2 years. Although some fiscal and productivity indices are more frequently used, there are a diverse number of factors used to measure productivity, finance, access, and other operational parameters in ARD dashboards. Thus, the information provided by each institutional dashboard may be significantly different from that in other ARDs.

The NCDR CathPCI Registry: a US national perspective on care and outcomes for percutaneous coronary intervention	HEART			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR DATA REGISTRY; MORTALITY RISK PREDICTION; STRATEGIES	Aims: The NCDR CathPCI Registry collects detailed clinical, process-of-care and outcomes data for patients undergoing coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the USA. The registry contributes to quality of care by providing data feedback on a wide range of performance metrics to participating centres and by facilitating local and national quality improvement efforts. Interventions: No treatments are mandated, participating centres receive routine quality-of-care and outcomes performance feedback reports and access to a quality dashboard for personalized performance reports. Population: Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and PCI are retrospectively identified. No informed consent is required, as data are anonymised. From inception in 1998, more than 12 million records have been submitted from 1577 participating US centres. Baseline data: Approximately 250 fields encompassing patient demographics, medical history and risk factors, hospital presentation, initial cardiac status, procedural details, medications, laboratory values, and in-hospital outcomes. Linkages with outside sources of data have permitted longitudinal outcomes assessment in some cases. Centre personnel enter the data into the registry, in some cases facilitated by software vendors. There are non-financial incentives for centre participation. Data completeness is noteworthy with most fields missing at rates less than 5%. A comprehensive data quality program is employed to enhance data validity. Endpoints: Main outcome measures include quality process metrics and in-hospital patient outcomes.

This lack of consensus is reflected in an inefficient multiplicity of survey instruments collecting information on various dimensions of food and nutrition security, with tremendous variation in the content, quality, and quantity of the information collected. No single existing survey instrument will ever be able to collect all needed indicators at the desired periodicity, and no single institution has either the mandate or the ability to measure and monitor food security in its many dimensions on a global scale. However, with better coordination across institutions and survey efforts, the state of food security measurement worldwide can be greatly improved. This paper attempts to identify the elements of a strategy, built around a combination of short-term fixes and long-term methodological advancements, to reverse the existing trends of poor coordination and slow methodological innovation in food security measurement and monitoring. International focus on a small dashboard of indicators, collected on a regular basis by different stakeholders through a number of available data collection options, is feasible and can be partially achieved by repurposing existing surveys to better suit food security monitoring goals.

We motivate our work through the prism of privacy issues in online social networks (OSN) acknowledging the fact that OSNs have become important platforms for information sharing. We note that on OSN platforms, individuals share very intimate details about different aspects of their lives, often lacking awareness about and understanding of the degree of accessibility/visibility of information they share as well as what it may implicitly reveal about them. Furthermore, service providers and other entities participating on OSN platforms are increasingly relying on profiling and analytics to find and extract valuable, often hidden patterns in large collections of data about OSN users. These issues have caused serious privacy concerns. In the light of such issues and concerns, we argue that protecting privacy online implies ensuring information and risk awareness, active control and oversight by the users over the collection and processing of their data, and support in assessing the trustworthiness of peers and service providers. Towards these goals, we propose the Personal Information Dashboard (PID), a system that relies on usable automation tools and intuitive visualizations to empower end-users to effectively manage both their personal data and their self-presentations. With the PID, the user is able to monitor and visualize her social networking footprint across multiple OSN domains. To enable this, the PID aggregates personal data from multiple sources and links the user's multiple OSN profiles. Leveraging various inference and correlation models as well as machine learning techniques, the PID empowers users to assess and understand the level of privacy risk they are facing when sharing information on OSNs. Based on outputs of the underlying prediction and learning methods, the PID can suggest to the user corrective options aimed at reducing risks of unintended information disclosure. We present a prototype implementation demonstrating the feasibility of our proposal.

A key aspect for this decision making is that software maps provide the structural context required for correct interpretation of these performance indicators. In parallel, source code repositories and collaboration platforms are an integral part of today's software-engineering tool set, but cannot properly incorporate software maps since implementations are only available as stand-alone applications. Hence, software maps are 'disconnected' from the main body of this tool set, rendering their use and provisioning overly complicated, which is one of the main reasons against regular use. We thus present a web-based rendering system for software maps that achieves both fast client-side page load time and interactive frame rates even with large software maps. We significantly reduce page load time by efficiently encoding hierarchy and geometry data for the net transport. Apart from that, appropriate interaction, layouting, and labeling techniques as well as common image enhancements aid evaluation of project-related quality aspects. Metrics provisioning can further be implemented by predefined attribute mappings to simplify communication of project specific quality aspects. The system is integrated into dashboards to demonstrate how our web-based approach makes software maps more accessible to many different stakeholders in software-engineering projects.

The availability of this data in a timely and easy to visualise way is an essential component of high-performing healthcare teams. It is recognised that good quality information is a driver of performance for clinical teams and helps ensure best possible care for patients. In 2012 the Internal Medicine Program at The Prince Charles Hospital developed a clinical dashboard that displays locally relevant information alongside relevant hospital and statewide metrics that inform daily clinical decision making. The data reported on the clinical dashboard is driven from data sourced from the electronic patient journey board in real time as well as other Queensland Health data sources. This provides clinicians with easy access to a wealth of local unit data presented in a simple graphical format that is being captured locally and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance. Local unit data informs daily decisions that identify and confirm patient flow problems, assist to identify root causes and enable evaluation of patient flow solutions.

In general, the farming and livestock activities can be used to obtain biomass sources for bioenergy production. Several raw materials (fatty acids sources) obtained from renewable sources can be employed to biodiesel production, providing biofuels with distinct physicochemical properties. Also, in Parana State, Brazil, products such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, beef tallow, and chicken fat are used for biodiesel manufacturing. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the engine generator performance using biodiesels obtained from soybean, sunflower, chicken fat and beef tallow compared to mineral diesel. The tests were performed using an engine with power of 7.36 kW on an electric generator with power of 5.5 kW. In engine load simulation, it was used as resistor bank, being the power generation selected on dashboard controller in the following sequences: 1.0 kW, 2.0 kW, 3.0 kW and 4.0 kW. The engine generator performance was evaluated by specific fuel consumption (SFC) and efficiency (eta). In general, the engine SFC using biodiesels was higher, when compared to diesel oil. However, the overall efficiency of engine generator with biodiesels was higher, with gain of up to 2.0%. Among the biodiesels compared to diesel oil, the best results for engine generator performance were obtained, respectively, from sunflower and soybean oils, due to lower increase in the SFC (7.6%) and slight increase in the overall efficiency.

Sediment samples are analyzed to determine the concentrations of about 170 chemical and physical variables. A Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI) was derived using the State of Washington Sediment Management Standards to account for the presence and concentrations of mixtures of toxicants. Mean Sediment Quality Standard quotients (mSQSq) were calculated as the basis for the SCI and compared to the incidence and degree of toxicity in laboratory tests and to metrics of the diversity and abundance of resident benthic assemblages in a database consisting of as many as 664 samples. These data were evaluated with co-occurrence analyses to identify cut points (i.e., thresholds) in the index below which the frequency and magnitude of biological effects were relatively low and above which they occurred with increasing frequency or magnitude. Iterative trials of different sets of cut points established the final cut points in mSQSq of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. They defined 4 ranges in chemical exposure: Minimum (<0.1), Low (0.1?<?0.3), Moderate (0.3?<?0.5), and Maximum (=0.5). Across these 4 exposure ranges both the incidence and magnitude of toxicity in some laboratory tests increased, the abundance of most stress-sensitive benthic taxa decreased, and the abundance of most stress-tolerant taxa increased. The mSQSq cut point of 0.1 appears to be the target value for protection of benthic resources, the value below which the probability and magnitude of adverse effects either in the laboratory or the field are the lowest. The mSQSq values are rescaled from 0 to 100 to form the SCI, used by the Puget Sound Partnership and environmental managers as a Dashboard Indicator, with biologically relevant targets selected to monitor ecosystem recovery.

A semantic proteomics dashboard (SemPoD) for data management in translational research	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM)	APR 22-24, 2012	Nashville, TN				MINIMUM INFORMATION; ONTOLOGY; PROVENANCE; FRAMEWORK	Background: One of the primary challenges in translational research data management is breaking down the barriers between the multiple data silos and the integration of 'omics data with clinical information to complete the cycle from the bench to the bedside. The role of contextual metadata, also called provenance information, is a key factor ineffective data integration, reproducibility of results, correct attribution of original source, and answering research queries involving "What", "Where", "When", "Which", "Who", "How", and "Why" (also known as the W7 model). But, at present there is limited or no effective approach to managing and leveraging provenance information for integrating data across studies or projects. Hence, there is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in creating a "provenance-aware" informatics platform to address this challenge. We introduce an ontology-driven, intuitive Semantic Proteomics Dashboard (SemPoD) that uses provenance together with domain information (semantic provenance) to enable researchers to query, compare, and correlate different types of data across multiple projects, and allow integration with legacy data to support their ongoing research. Results: The SemPoD platform, currently in use at the Case Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics (CPB), consists of three components: (a) Ontology-driven Visual Query Composer, (b) Result Explorer, and (c) Query Manager. Currently, SemPoD allows provenance-aware querying of 1153 mass-spectrometry experiments from 20 different projects. SemPod uses the systems molecular biology provenance ontology (SysPro) to support a dynamic query composition interface, which automatically updates the components of the query interface based on previous user selections and efficientlyprunes the result set usinga "smart filtering" approach. The SysPro ontology re-uses terms from the PROV-ontology (PROV-O) being developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provenance working group, the minimum information required for reporting a molecular interaction experiment (MIMIx), and the minimum information about a proteomics experiment (MIAPE) guidelines. The SemPoD was evaluated both in terms of user feedback and as scalability of the system. Conclusions: SemPoD is an intuitive and powerful provenance ontology-driven data access and query platform that uses the MIAPE and MIMIx metadata guideline to create an integrated view over large-scale systems molecular biology datasets. SemPoD leverages the SysPro ontology to create an intuitive dashboard for biologists to compose queries, explore the results, and use a query manager for storing queries for later use. SemPoD can be deployed over many existing database applications storing 'omics data, including, as illustrated here, the LabKey data-management system. The initial user feedback evaluating the usability and functionality of SemPoD has been very positive and it is being considered for wider deployment beyond the proteomics domain, and in other 'omics' centers.

The applicability and practicability of the LCSD is reported thanks to a case study. The results show that LCSA can be considered a valuable tool to support decision-making processes that involve different stakeholders with different knowledge and background. The sustainability performance of the production step of Italian and German polycrystalline silicon modules is assessed using the LCSD. The LCSD is an application oriented to the presentation of an LCSA study. LCSA comprises life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing and social LCA (S-LCA). The primary data collected for the German module are related to two different years, and this led to the evaluation of three different scenarios: a German 2008 module, a German 2009 module, and an Italian 2008 module. According to the LCA results based on Ecoindicator 99, the German module for example has lower values of land use [1.77 potential disappeared fractions (PDF) m(2)/year] and acidification (3.61 PDF m(2)/year) than the Italian one (land use 1.99 PDF m(2)/year, acidification 3.83 PDF m(2)/year). However, the German module has higher global warming potential [4.5E-05 disability-adjusted life years (DALY)] than the Italian one [3.00E-05 DALY]. The economic costs of the German module are lower than the Italian one, e.g. the cost of electricity per FU for the German module is 0.12 a,not sign/m(2) compared to the Italian 0.85 a,not sign/m(2). The S-LCA results show significant differences between German module 2008 and 2009 that represent respectively the best and the worst overall social performances of the three considered scenarios compared by LCSD. The aggregate LCSD results show that the German module 2008 has the best overall sustainability performance and a score of 665 points out of 1,000 (and a colour scale of light green). The Italian module 2008 has the worst overall sustainability performance with a score of 404 points, while the German module 2009 is in the middle with 524 points. The LCSA and LCSD methodologies represent an applicable framework as a tool for supporting decision-making processes which consider sustainable production and consumption. However, there are still challenges for a meaningful application, particularly the questions of the selection of social LCA indicators and how to weigh sets for the LCSD.

Performance Dashboard for a Pharmaceutical Project Benchmarking Program	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article						Benchmarking; Construction management; Performance dashboard; Performance evaluation; Performance measurement; Pharmaceutical project	CONSTRUCTION PROJECT; MEASUREMENT SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; INDICATORS; PERCEPTION; SCORECARD	Performance measurement is essential to controlling and improving capital projects. Increasingly, industry sectors demand an industry-specific performance measurement system because their unique processes can result in significant differences in performance outcomes. This paper presents the development of a performance dashboard for a pharmaceutical project benchmarking program. The proposed approach adopts a relative comparison method and uses weighted key performance indicators (KPIs) to compare project performance. The dashboard generates an overall performance score both at the project level and at the company level, as shown in tabular and graphical formats. The dashboard provides flexibility for comparing the performance of projects even when the project types or KPIs are different. Although the study focuses on a performance dashboard for pharmaceutical industry projects, the dashboard development process described in this paper can be applied to other industry projects.

Pediatric hospital medicine: A strategic planning roundtable to chart the future	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							PERSPECTIVES	Given the growing field of Pediatric Hospital Medicine (PHM) and the need to define strategic direction, the Society of Hospital Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Academic Pediatric Association sponsored a roundtable to discuss the future of the field. Twenty-one leaders were invited plus a facilitator utilizing established health care strategic planning methods. A vision statement was developed. Specific initiatives in 4 domains (clinical practice, quality of care, research, and workforce) were identified that would advance PHM with a plan to complete each initiative. Review of the current issues demonstrated gaps between the current state of affairs and the full vision of the potential impact of PHM. Clinical initiatives were to develop an educational plan supporting the PHM Core Competencies and a clinical practice monitoring dashboard template. Quality initiatives included an environmental assessment of PHM participation on key committees, societies, and agencies to ensure appropriate PHM representation. Three QI collaboratives are underway. A Research Leadership Task Force was created and the Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS) network was refocused, defining a strategic framework for PRIS, and developing a funding strategy. Workforce initiatives were to develop a descriptive statement that can be used by any PHM physician, a communications tool describing value added of PHM; and a tool to assess career satisfaction among PHM physicians. We believe the Roundtable was successful in describing the current state of PHM and laying a course for the near future. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2012.

HammerCloud was previously introduced with the goals of enabling VO- and site-administrators to run such tests in an automated or on-demand manner. The ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments have all developed VO plugins for the service and have successfully integrated it into their grid operations infrastructures. This work will present the experience in running HammerCloud at full scale for more than 3 years and present solutions to the scalability issues faced by the service. First, we will show the particular challenges faced when integrating with CMS and LHCb offline computing, including customized dashboards to show site validation reports for the VOs and a new API to tightly integrate with the LHCbDIRAC Resource Status System. Next, a study of the automatic site exclusion component used by ATLAS will be presented along with results for tuning the exclusion policies. A study of the historical test results for ATLAS, CMS and LHCb will be presented, including comparisons between the experiments' grid availabilities and a search for site-based or temporal failure correlations. Finally, we will look to future plans that will allow users to gain new insights into the test results; these include developments to allow increased testing concurrency, increased scale in the number of metrics recorded per test job (up to hundreds), and increased scale in the historical job information (up to many millions of jobs per VO).

Greenhouse Gas Dashboard allows performance engineers; managers and employees to easily enter, monitor and report power plant emissions. Coal fired and Gas fired power stations are supported by Dashboard in conjunction with SentientSystem resource servers. Researching Australian and International standards on carbon reduction and energy efficiency, common components were extracted that are used in the dashboard. Uncertainty analysis is conducted on the multiple pillar calculation method to lower and verify error margins. Once implemented in an excel spreadsheet with test data, the final prototype has been developed into a web server and hence accessed as a web tool. This prototype will then be integrated into the SentientSystem (TM) owned by Synergetic Engineering.

However, the cost of information and of combining and making it available in the appropriate context make this a tricky trade-off. Fortunately, Semantic Web technologies make it possible to easily publish and reuse data. But this is not simple data, it is semantic data, which makes it easier to query, browse and combine it. Apart from semantic data, it is also important a user interface that carries all this potential to the user. Rhizomer is a framework for semantic data publishing and user interaction that facilitates building semantic dashboards. It is possible, for instance, to build a simple dashboard on top of semantic data generated from financial reports and incorporate web services that provide specialised ways to interact with semantic data, like showing geo-located resources in a map or events in a timeline.

A Re-conceptualization of Access for 21st Century Healthcare	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review						access; e-health; digital; connectivity; veterans		Many e-health technologies are available to promote virtual patient-provider communication outside the context of face-to-face clinical encounters. Current digital communication modalities include cell phones, smartphones, interactive voice response, text messages, e-mails, clinic-based interactive video, home-based web-cams, mobile smartphone two-way cameras, personal monitoring devices, kiosks, dashboards, personal health records, web-based portals, social networking sites, secure chat rooms, and on-line forums. Improvements in digital access could drastically diminish the geographical, temporal, and cultural access problems faced by many patients. Conversely, a growing digital divide could create greater access disparities for some populations. As the paradigm of healthcare delivery evolves towards greater reliance on non-encounter-based digital communications between patients and their care teams, it is critical that our theoretical conceptualization of access undergoes a concurrent paradigm shift to make it more relevant for the digital age. The traditional conceptualizations and indicators of access are not well adapted to measure access to health services that are delivered digitally outside the context of face-to-face encounters with providers. This paper provides an overview of digital "encounterless" utilization, discusses the weaknesses of traditional conceptual frameworks of access, presents a new access framework, provides recommendations for how to measure access in the new framework, and discusses future directions for research on access.

Digital Dashboard Design Using Multiple Data Streams for Disease Surveillance With Influenza Surveillance as an Example	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Dashboard; dissemination; surveillance; influenza	SYSTEM	Background: Great strides have been made exploring and exploiting new and different sources of disease surveillance data and developing robust statistical methods for analyzing the collected data. However, there has been less research in the area of dissemination. Proper dissemination of surveillance data can facilitate the end user's taking of appropriate actions, thus maximizing the utility of effort taken from upstream of the surveillance-to-action loop. Objective: The aims of the study were to develop a generic framework for a digital dashboard incorporating features of efficient dashboard design and to demonstrate this framework by specific application to influenza surveillance in Hong Kong. Methods: Based on the merits of the national websites and principles of efficient dashboard design, we designed an automated influenza surveillance digital dashboard as a demonstration of efficient dissemination of surveillance data. We developed the system to synthesize and display multiple sources of influenza surveillance data streams in the dashboard. Different algorithms can be implemented in the dashboard for incorporating all surveillance data streams to describe the overall influenza activity. Results: We designed and implemented an influenza surveillance dashboard that utilized self-explanatory figures to display multiple surveillance data streams in panels. Indicators for individual data streams as well as for overall influenza activity were summarized in the main page, which can be read at a glance. Data retrieval function was also incorporated to allow data sharing in standard format. Conclusions: The influenza surveillance dashboard serves as a template to illustrate the efficient synthesization and dissemination of multiple-source surveillance data, which may also be applied to other diseases. Surveillance data from multiple sources can be disseminated efficiently using a dashboard design that facilitates the translation of surveillance information to public health actions.

It relies on a large, distributed computing system composed of thousands of software applications running concurrently. In such a complex environment, information sharing is fundamental for controlling applications behavior, error reporting and operational monitoring. During data taking, the streams of messages sent by applications and data published via information services are constantly monitored by experts to verify the correctness of running operations and to understand problematic situations. To simplify and improve system analysis and errors detection tasks, we developed the TDAQ Analytics Dashboard, a web application that aims to collect, correlate and visualize effectively this real time flow of information. The TDAQ Analytics Dashboard is composed of two main entities that reflect the twofold scope of the application. The first is the engine, a Java service that performs aggregation, processing and filtering of real time data stream and computes statistical correlation on sliding windows of time. The results are made available to clients via a simple web interface supporting SQL-like query syntax. The second is the visualization, provided by an Ajax-based web application that runs on client's browser. The dashboard approach allows to present information in a clear and customizable structure. Several types of interactive graphs are proposed as widgets that can be dynamically added and removed from visualization panels. Each widget acts as a client for the engine, querying the web interface to retrieve data with desired criteria. In this paper we present the design, development and evolution of the TDAQ Analytics Dashboard. We also present the statistical analysis computed by the application in this first period of high energy data taking operations for the ATLAS experiment.

Governments as one of the giant organizations of any society trace missions and some goals. Probably, the most important mission of states is accomplishing social justice. In order to reach it governments must realize social problems and try to solve them and achieve collectivity benefit. Digital dashboards are a common feature of an Executive Information System (EIS) that integrate information from multiple components and tailor the information to individual preferences;they commonly be employed to assist managers to identify the status of key information or critical factors of success. The author's purpose in the present article is implementation of this concept in order to help authorities to take advantages of IT Digital dashboards can use as a tool for link goals to strategies. The most important object is to realize that which information must be included in digital dashboards and how must this information be shown so that we reach the best information in minimum time. Since governments make macro, strategic decisions, they face huge and diverse data and information. Using IT and its capabilities will help to prevent from losing data and information as well as inexpensive data processing, because it does not look for everything available, it only looks for key performance indicators (KPI)s. Digital dashboards include important information so it is necessary to describe different availability levels for different users so that electronic reliance can be reached. Result of this article shows that if digital dashboards are designed and implemented correctly, the results will be: Accountability, rapidity in decision making, accessing information within large data sets, and analyzing that information for managing performance. Being inexpensive in overall administrative costs and moving across real goals instead of superficial goals such as maintenance of employees and image of power as the origin of their stability- are other advantages.

Apart from having proactive measures to secure their application and infrastructure, many see monitoring dashboards as crucial investment in disaster preparedness. As companies struggle to find the best solution to cater for their needs and interest for monitoring their application and infrastructure's health, this paper summarizes the studies made on several known off-the-shelf operations dashboard and in-house developed dashboard. A few criteria of good dashboard are collected from previous studies carried out by several researchers and rank them according to importance and business needs. The finalized criteria that will be discussed in later sections are data visualization, performance indicator, dashboard personalization, audit capability and alert/notification. Comparative studies between several popular dashboards were then carried out to determine whether they met these criteria that we derived from the first exercise. The findings hopefully can be used to educate and provide an overview of selecting the best IT application and infrastructure operations dashboard that suit business needs, thus become the main contribution of this paper.

A specially tailored information technology solution was deployed within the hospital, The solution included a hospital administration system as well as a complete electronic medical record. A light-weight picture archiving and communication system was also deployed. During 10 days of operation, the system registered 1111 patients. The network and system up times were more than 99.9%. Patient movements within the hospital were noted, and an online command dashboard screen was generated. Patient care was delivered using the electronic medical record. Digital radiographs were acquired and transmitted to stations throughout the hospital. The system helped to introduce order in an otherwise chaotic situation and enabled adequate utilization of scarce medical resources by continually gathering information, analyzing it, and presenting it to the decision-making command level. The establishment of electronic medical records promoted the adequacy of medical treatment and facilitated continuity of care. This experience in Haiti supports the feasibility of deploying information technologies within a field hospital operation. Disaster response teams and agencies are encouraged to consider the use of information technology as part of their contingency plans.

This paper confirms and extends this proposition by providing data from an international research project investigating which student online activities accurately predict academic achievement. Analysis of LMS tracking data from a Blackboard Vista-supported course identified 15 variables demonstrating a significant simple correlation with student final grade. Regression modelling generated a best-fit predictive model for this course which incorporates key variables such as total number of discussion messages posted, total number of mail messages sent, and total number of assessments completed and which explains more than 30% of the variation in student final grade. Logistic modelling demonstrated the predictive power of this model, which correctly identified 81% of students who achieved a failing grade. Moreover, network analysis of course discussion forums afforded insight into the development of the student learning community by identifying disconnected students, patterns of student-to-student communication, and instructor positioning within the network. This study affirms that pedagogically meaningful information can be extracted from LMS-generated student tracking data, and discusses how these findings are informing the development of a customizable dashboard-like reporting tool for educators that will extract and visualize real-time data on student engagement and likelihood of success.

To be able to cope with such a large scale heterogeneous infrastructure, it is necessary to have monitoring tools providing a complete and reliable view of the overall performance of the sites. Moreover, the structure of a monitoring system critically depends on the object to monitor and on the users it is addressed to. In this article we will describe two different monitoring systems both aimed to monitor activities and services provided in the WLCG framework, but designed in order to meet the requirements of different users: Site Status Board has an overall view of the services available in all the sites supporting an experiment, whereas Siteview provides a complete view of all the activities going on at a site, for all the experiments supported by the site.

Particularly, aeronautical firms are considered in the practical application of the method: some strategic goals of the network are selected and a dashboard of indexes is adopted to establish specific control points. A variation in one, or more, indicator/s will allow to promptly investigate on the interested part of the network which could negatively affect its overall performance.

Yet, there is a dearth of research on the development of such dashboards. This paper discusses the experiences gained from a pioneering Living Lab on the development and evaluation of dashboards for assessing crisis preparedness. In order to evaluate and further improve dashboards, a two-day user-centered gaming simulation was organized with forty relief agency managers. A survey distributed amongst the managers indicates that they were satisfied with the dashboards and intend to use these in practice. However, the managers suggested that the formulation and clustering of the performance indicators requires better alignment with the context of use. One of the main findings is that the high level of uncertainty regarding the final set of performance indicators and the corresponding norms demands flexibility in the dashboard architecture beyond the evaluation stage.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and experiment of Trouble Dashboard (TD), an adaptive, flexible, and low overhead failure monitoring system. Our goal is to provide a lightweight, scalable failure-monitoring tool for both application scientists and system managers. In TD, a set of APIs is provided for application scientists to control the behavior of their applications with flexibility when failures happen. System managers can use the tool to monitor the status of not only computing nodes and running tasks but also failures when they occur. Experiments show that TD incurs low overhead, and remains accurate and flexible enough to adapt to various applications.

For that purpose, a software called "Expert Explorer" has been designed by Ideea Advertising. Anonymized datasets have been extracted from hospitals into a common repository. The tool has 3 main features. (1) It can display hospital stays in a visual and comprehensive way (diagnoses, drugs, lab results, etc.) using tables and pretty charts. (2) It allows designing and executing dashboards in order to generate knowledge about ADEs. (3) It finally allows uploading decision rules obtained from data mining.

A novel system called VERTIGO is to be crafted to tackle the current limitations in media consumption across different contexts. On the end-user side, VERTIGO would provide a context-aware, personalised and proactive dashboard with innovative discovery and interaction capabilities; on the enterprise side, media professionals would gain access to a common platform enabling new collaboration models in the value network.

This tool brings together, in a coordinated and effective manner, several first-principles physics simulation codes, stability analysis packages, and data processing and visualization tools. A Kepler workflow is used in order to carry out an edge plasma simulation that loosely couples the kinetic code, XGC0, with an ideal MHD linear stability analysis code, ELITE, and an extended MHD initial value code such as M3D or NIMROD. XGC0 includes the neoclassical ion-electron-neutral dynamics needed to simulate pedestal growth near the separatrix. The Kepler workflow processes the XGC0 simulation results into simple images that can be selected and displayed via the Dashboard, a monitoring tool implemented in AJAX allowing the scientist to track computational resources, examine running and archived jobs, and view key physics data, all within a standard Web browser. The XGC0 simulation is monitored for the conditions needed to trigger an ELM crash by periodically assessing the edge plasma pressure and current density profiles using the ELITE code. If an ELM crash is triggered, the Kepler workflow launches the M3D code on a moderate-size Opteron cluster to simulate the nonlinear ELM crash and to compute the relaxation of plasma profiles after the crash. This process is monitored through periodic outputs of plasma fluid quantities that are automatically visualized with AVS/Express and may be displayed on the Dashboard. Finally, the Kepler workflow archives all data. outputs and processed images using HPSS, as well as provenance information about the software and hardware used to create the simulation. The complete process of preparing, executing and monitoring a coupled-code simulation of the edge pressure pedestal buildup and the ELM cycle using the Kepler scientific workflow system is described in this paper.

Using a large-scale, real-world database, the authors test the effects of both customer satisfaction and customer complaint on the stock value gap of firms. The results show that customer complaint has a stronger effect than customer satisfaction on the value gap. Furthermore, there is some support for the moderating influences of working capital and firm specialization. The results provide actionable guidelines to build a more complete customer equity dashboard and encourage managers to provide a supportive organizational environment to create shareholder value.

The material selection of mold and resin in the NIL process for ARS is very important for the purpose of real application and mass production. Generally, the mold should have flexibility for continuous mass production and final structure should have strong durability under outdoor environment. In this work, the effect of single side and dual side patterning were investigated by change of pitch from moth-eye to photonic crystal on the flexible polymer substrate by using NIL. Then, the effect of fluorine resin with low refractive index was tested. Finally, a fabrication method of ARS of pitch of 250nm with high fidelity and accuracy using the high-resolution PDMS mold by aid of solvent mixing of low viscosity was presented. Generally, it is difficult for Sylgard PDMS to make nanopattern below 300nm pitch without special treatment.

Design/methodology/approach - We use 16 traits addressing safety (S), quality (Q), delivery (D) and cost (C) areas for evaluating performance of a vendor on a linear 10 point scale. We start with evaluating each "supplier-supply item" combination and compute gross averages for each of the SQDC areas and finally arrive at an "Overall Performance Index" for each supplier-supply item combination. These indices form a "Vendor Performance Dashboard" for decision making. Findings - The case study shows that the proposed method is quick and easy to adopt, and provides a logical framework for vendor selection and management, based on performance in the four critical (SQDC) areas. Research limitations/implications - A lot of monotonous computations are required for the proposed vendor evaluation process. Hence, the scope for software development warrants further investigation. There is also a need to develop a process for weighting the different SQDC elements for application in different industry/market contexts. Originality/value - This paper presents a unique and simple approach for generating dashboard data for decisions regarding evaluation of vendors and distribution of sub-contracts in a dynamic technology intensive market with practical examples. The proposed model for vendor selection and determination of order sizes is less dependent on complex algorithms and more practical and logically framed than existing models.

Additionally, faster scanners, more detailed exams, and increased demand for imaging services have precipitated a potential image overload for today's radiologists who are pressured to provide efficient, quality service in less time. Radiologists are faced with the task of operating within complex systems but are lacking tools to efficiently and effectively monitor these systems in real time. Dashboard technology can help address this deficiency in radiology and facilitate informed, optimized decisions about workflow. Possible areas of application include workflow consolidation, workload distribution, and urgency evaluation. Dashboards should be optimized, context-sensitive, customizable, and workflow-integrated. Further research is needed to identify the most important dashboard metrics, determine their optimal display, and validate their utility.

The health and state of the targeted resources depend both on ecosystem characteristics (as determined by ecological and biological factors) and on fishing pressure, whose effects are only partly known. Increasing harvests from commercial and recreational fishing increasingly overlap with traditional Subsistence activity, creating an important CRF management challenge. This paper presents a new approach to CRF assessment and monitoring by providing a set of multidisciplinary indicators. The fisheries system is assessed from three different viewpoints: ecology of targeted populations, exploitation and the broader socio-econornic fishery context. The use of complementary indicators chosen from each of these fields could balance the chronic lack of human and financial resources for the management of these fisheries. We suggest the use of these indicators through an assessment grid or an indicator dashboard specifically adapted to given situations and management objectives determined through a participatory approach. The operational efficiency of this dashboard depends on i) dialogue between users, ii) the objectivity of the proposed monitoring, iii) the Visual transcription of divergent/convergent interests amongst stakeholders, and iv) stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process. The use and constraints of such a tool are described with reference to Ouvea atoll (New-Caledonia, South Pacific) for which an analysis of available indicators for assessing fisheries status is presented.

Dashboards enable interactive graphical displays of complex information and support flexible analytic capabilities for user customizability and extensibiliry. Dashboards commonly include software requirements and design metrics because they provide leading indicators for project size, growth, and stability. This paper focuses on dashboards that have been used on actual large-scale projects as well as example empirical relationships revealed by the dashboards. The empirical results focus on leading indicators for requirements and design of large-scale systems. In the first set of 14 projects focusing on requirements metrics, the ratio of software requirements to source-lines-of-code averaged 1:46 Projects that far exceeded the 1:46 requirements-to-code ratio tended to be more effort-intensive and fault-prone during verification. In the second set of 16 projects focusing on design metrics, the components in the top quartile of the number of component internal states had 62 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by si:e. The components in the top quartile of the number of component interactions had 4.3 times more faults on average than did the components in the bottom quartile, after normalization by size. When the number of component internal states was in the bottom quartile, the component fault-proneness was low even when the number of component interactions was in the upper quartiles, regardless of size normalization. Measurement-driven dashboards reveal insights that increase visibility into large-scale systems and provide feedback to organizations and projects.

MOPS Systems delivers a Manufacturing Information Warehouse (MIW) that supports your mill operation decisions: Knowledge. Process and Product information management to improve decision-making support. One of the biggest challenges in the mill today is the overabundance of data. This includes data from various sources, systems and electronic databases, but also data that reside in various written logbooks throughout the mill. The comments and notes written in these logs are often the only place where the resolution of problems, or follow up for given issues will be written down. In the past, getting access to this information and knowledge meant going, out there and finding the right book: often easier said than done. Today, mills can achieve knowledge of process and product information management by turning multiple sources of data into useful information using an MIW. This MIW stores multiple types of data from multiple areas and sources of the mill. It includes applications to consolidate. relate and structure the data to provide all users seamless integration for real time decision-making of process and product information. There are today real-time tools for viewing. modifying, communicating and creating operations logs, notes and information. MOPS LogBook ties together important and critical operational comments with process-related events. Users can access any comment in any part of the mill from their desktop, and link it to any process-related parameter. MOPS LogBook provides a central place for keeping human responses to events, product and process such as production losses, off quality or equipment problems. Operators can use it to make notes regarding maintenance needs, operational issues, actions or suggestions for quality improvements. Comments can be assigned to specific departments or service personnel for follow up by those areas. An MIW that includes an electronic MOPS LogBook closes the human loop as it links the operators actions with specific events in the mill. It is an important tool for management to keep abreast of operating problems and procedures. To provide seamless integration to the users, the key is a centralized recording of comments and notes that relates operations experience to on-line operational data. User interfaces are very flexible and easily configurable to be customized to serve the needs of each individual. Using a highly customizable window dashboard technology, it offers an efficient real-time decision-making support tool to improve mill operations, maximize quality, reduce variability, and lower costs. MOPS LogBook, along with an effective MIW also provides advanced filtering and searching functions to save time by reducing the amount of time needed to locate and find information. An on-line audit trail is provided for complying with ISO requirements. Notes are stored with their creation date and time, user name, log entry and the operations area for which the log entry is applied.

A basic foundation of CQI is the importance that data has to informed decision making. While detailed data has always been provided to administration there was a desire to have a "high level" report which could be used to quickly gauge the overall-performance of the organization and prompt action where necessary. A project to develop a high level "Dashboard" of indicators was undertaken. The selection process of indicators was complex since they needed to reflect a balance between sometimes competing forces; those of Finance, Operations, Customer interests, and Innovation. A set of criteria were developed to identify the first set of indicators. Once the indicators were identified, and definitions established, historical data was collected where possible. Using a PC based spreadsheet/graphics program, a report was developed which uses control charts to show the indicators performance over time (variability around a mean).
