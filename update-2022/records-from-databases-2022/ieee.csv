Several factors must be accounted; from the data to be displayed to the audience that will use the dashboard. However; the increase in popularity of these tools has extended their use in several and very different contexts among very different user profiles. This popularization has increased the necessity of building tailored displays focused on specific requirements; goals; user roles; situations; domains; etc. Requirements are more sophisticated and varying; thus; dashboards need to match them to enhance knowledge generation and support more complex decision-making processes. This sophistication has led to the proposal of new approaches to address personal requirements and foster individualization regarding dashboards without involving high quantities of resources and long development processes. The goal of this work is to present a systematic review of the literature to analyze and classify the existing dashboard solutions that support tailoring capabilities and the methodologies used to achieve them. The methodology follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results; 23 papers about tailored dashboards were retrieved. Three main approaches were identified regarding tailored solutions: customization; personalization; and adaptation. However; there is a wide variety of employed paradigms and features to develop tailored dashboards. The present systematic literature review analyzes challenges and issues regarding the existing solutions. It also identifies new research paths to enhance tailoring capabilities and thus; to improve user experience and insight delivery when it comes to visual analysis.";2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933472;"Ministerio de Educación; Cultura y Deporte(grant numbers:FPU17/03276); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TIN2016-80172-R); PROVIDEDH Project; funded within the CHIST-ERA Programme; MINECO; Spain; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:PCIN-2017-064); Consejería de Educación; Junta de Castilla y León(grant numbers:SA061P17); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789402;"SLR;systematic literature review;tailoring;custom;personalized;adaptive;information dashboards";"Systematics;Bibliographies;Tools;Visualization;Planning;User experience;Artificial intelligence";"decision making;human computer interaction;information retrieval;software engineering";"information dashboards;tailored displays;user roles;complex decision-making processes;personal requirements;long development processes;tailored dashboards;user experience;user profiles;software engineering;customization;personalization;adaptation;visual analysis";;7;;56;CCBY;6 Aug 2019;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals;;;;;;;;;;;

Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use; and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics; data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study; we present QualDash; a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals; a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI; using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards; and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card; while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of OualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals.

M.C. Dean; an electrical design-build firm; recognized the importance of effective energy tracking methods in the large; complex buildings that it manages. Energy guidelines; such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); are implemented to increase energy efficiency. Acquiring a LEED certification provides building owners with incentives; but it requires an in-depth documentation and understanding of energy usage prior to certification. Previously; M.C. Dean manually calculated average energy usage and created control charts that summarized annual statistics of their buildings. This method is sufficient for a single site but is an inefficient practice when applied manually across multiple sites. This project performed a requirements elicitation to determine the critical criteria for analyzing energy usage for M.C. Dean's buildings. The results were used to develop a standardized Excel-based dashboard tool that instructs the user on importing and modifying raw energy data. Once the data is imported; the dashboard tool automatically tests for normality via probability plots and generates 3-sigma control charts. By automating this process; the dashboard tool enabled the user to gain detailed understanding of the energy usage of their site. Areas of potential improvement were identified through the implementation of three additional methods: analytic hierarchy process; cost simulation; and cost-benefit analysis. The manager's preferences and energy guidelines generated a ranking of building usage factors; which can guide decisions on repurposing certain building elements. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed using parametric distribution analysis to predict future costs. Additionally; the dashboard increases awareness of energy usage by linking energy performance to the LEED Operations and Maintenance version 4.1 guidelines to estimate the current certification level and highlight areas for improvement. This research produced an energy performance tool that can be standardized to other complex buildings. It provides efficient energy tracking using standardized methods; allowing building owners to objectively assess the potential adoption of economical and sustainable practices.";;978-1-7281-7145-6;10.1109/SIEDS49339.2020.9106664;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106664;"statistical modeling;process improvement;information systems";;"analytic hierarchy process;building management systems;buildings (structures);control charts;cost-benefit analysis;energy conservation;energy consumption;Monte Carlo methods;probability";"standardized Excel-based dashboard tool;energy guidelines;building elements;energy performance tool;energy efficiency analysis;energy tracking methods;energy consumption;building operations;electrical design-build firm;LEED certification;requirements elicitation;probability plots;3-sigma control charts;analytic hierarchy process;Monte Carlo simulation;parametric distribution analysis";;;;5;;2-jun-20;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences;;;;;;;;;;;

By means of a cognitive task analysis; consisting of classroom observations; interviews; and several expert meetings; teachers' skills; and knowledge necessary for providing differentiated instruction when using teacher dashboards and ALSs were disentangled. These findings were compared with the skills and knowledge needed by teachers providing differentiated instruction without these tools. Results show that teachers' dashboards can support teachers when providing differentiated instruction by providing up-to-date information about students' progress. Nevertheless; coping with the new information provided on the dashboards also requires new skills and knowledge such as interpreting information from the dashboard and understanding how the information in the ALS is calculated.

While learners practice on a tablet real-time data indicating learner progress and performance is displayed on teacher dashboards. This study examines how teachers use the dashboards; applying Verberts' learning analytics process model. Teacher dashboard consultations and resulting pedagogical actions were observed in 38 mathematics lessons. In stimulated recall interviews; the 38 teachers were asked to elaborate on how they reflect on and make sense of the information on the dashboard. The results showed that teachers consulted the dashboard on average 8.3 times per lesson. Teachers activated existing knowledge about students and the class to interpret dashboard information. Task and process feedback were the pedagogical actions most often used following dashboard consultation. Additionally; teachers who consulted the dashboard more often activated more and more diverse pedagogical knowledge to interpret the data and; consequently; gave more and more diverse feedback. These results indicated that teacher dashboards were indeed influencing teachers' pedagogical actions in their daily classroom activities.

Educational institutions are using Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) to provide students with timely and personalized feedback in visual format. LAD use advanced analytical capabilities that capitalize on online learner activities that are extracted from log files. They provide data-driven insights on current learning contexts and inform management on any learning intervention strategies that may be needed to support students in achieving their learning outcomes. Besides students; the perspective of instructors too is considered. Using easy-to-read graphical reporting formats (e.g.; line graphs; scatter plot; bar charts; etc.); the LAD reveals a consolidated view of how online learning is taking place. In this manner; a snapshot depicting details of student learning patterns can enable instructors to monitor their students' learning strategies. At the same time; the LAD assists students too by providing them with a personalized environment to help them engage better with the learning outcomes. Therefore; LAD is increasingly used as a pedagogical approach to motivate students and help build their self-learning capacity.

Using an interactive dashboard a user is able to review the generation process in real time and receive suggestions from the system for edits to be made. The adversaries can be used to both diagnose robustness issues within a single classifier or to compare various classifier options. With the weaknesses identified; the framework can also be used as a first step in mitigating adversarial threats.

With the rise of Blockchain-based systems; identities are becoming even more critical than before; mainly due to the immutability property. In fact; many publicly accessible Blockchain networks like Ethereum rely on pseudonymization as a method for identifying subject actions. Pseudonyms are often employed to maintain anonymity; but true anonymity requires unlinkability. Without this property; any attacker can examine the messages sent by a specific pseudonym and learn new information about the holder of this pseudonym. This use of Blockchain collides with regulations because of the right to be forgotten; and Blockchain-based solutions are ensuring that every data stored within the chain will not be modified. In this paper we define a method and a tool for dealing with digital identities within Blockchain environments that are compliant with regulations. The proposed method provides a way to grant digital pseudo identities unlinked to the real identity.

The Energy-Water-Emissions Dashboard (EWED) is a novel environmental data management system that integrates multiple heterogeneous data sources and provides information for nearly 10;000 individual power plants across the United States. This article describes our empirical research of using machine learning models for electricity prediction and water usage in the context of water availability constraints. We evaluate the use of linear regression; decision tree regression; random forest regression; eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Based on the performance evaluation of each model; we use ANN for generation and water consumption and XGBoost for water withdrawal prediction in the production environment. Model performance evaluation is based on statistical measures including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE); Mean Absolute Error (MAE); coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>); Willmott's Index of Agreement (WIA); RMSE-observations to Standard deviation Ratio (RSR); Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC); and Percent Bias (PBIAS). This article presents performance improvements of our machine learning approach compared to the conventional coefficient method used by EWED; for example; RMSE decreased 8.1% in generation; 59% in water consumption; and 53% in water withdrawal prediction.

To overcome this limitation; what is needed is a way to systemically explore the decision space of a historical case and then perturb the case by changing assumptions to assess the impact of those changes on the outcome space. This paper formalizes the representation of cases from historical case studies to illuminate key decision and tradeoffs that bear on the outcome.

Although this approach yields accurate results; it can be costly and labor intensive and not suitable for continuous tracking of soil properties. Advances in soil sensor and wireless technologies are poised to replace physical sampling and offline measurement with in-field monitoring. This article reports the development; deployment; and validation of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system for continuous monitoring of soil health. The end nodes of the proposed system; called soil health monitoring units (SHMUs); are solar powered and can be installed on a field for extended periods of time. Each SHMU transmits soil temperature; moisture; electrical conductivity; carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>); and geolocation data wirelessly using long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) radio technology. Data are received by a LoRaWAN gateway; which uploads it to a server for long-term storage and analysis. Users can view acquired data through a Web-based dashboard. The following significant experiments were carried out to validate the developed system: 1) a network consisting of eight SHMUs was deployed at an agricultural field site for several weeks and soil health metrics were analyzed using the soil health dashboard; 2) the flexibility of the system was demonstrated by the addition of an extra CO<sub>2</sub> sensor allowing an additional variable directly linked to soil health to be recorded; 3) a wireless communication range of 3422 m was estimated at a transmission power of 10 dBm by deploying the developed system on a large field; 4) the average current consumption of a SHMU (including its associated sensors) was estimated to be 13 mA; at this rate; the onboard Li-ion battery is able to sustain a SHMU for several days; and 5) a 7 cm ×6.5 cm solar panel was able to fully charge the onboard battery in 14 days while supplying power to the SHMU.";2327-4662;;10.1109/JIOT.2021.3056586;"Universidad Nacional de San Agustin Arequipa Peru(grant numbers:Nexus Institute for Food; Energy; Water and the En); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344804;"Agriculture;environmental monitoring;Internet of Things (IoT);long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN);real-time systems;self-powered;sensor systems;soil measurements;solar power";"Soil;Monitoring;Moisture;Internet of Things;Zigbee;Wireless sensor networks;Soil measurements";"condition monitoring;energy measurement;Internet of Things;secondary cells;soil;wide area networks";"in-field monitoring;Internet-of-Things system;continuous monitoring;SHMU;soil temperature;wide-area network radio technology;agricultural field site;Web-based dashboard;soil health monitoring units;offline measurement;physical sampling;soil health assessment;LoRaWAN IoT-based soil health monitoring system;soil health dashboard;CO2;Li";;;;57;IEEE;2-feb-21;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals;;;;;;;;;;;

The approach focuses on the collection of Critical Parameters generated during endurance runs and translating these into system robustness numbers like (Cp/Cpk); system time-to-failure data and failure mode information and Crow-AMSAA (NHPP) graphs. The robustness numbers are used for a daily management dashboard and used as input for actions to drive continuous improvement of the system dependability.During the development process of a medical device; endurance runs were executed on early prototypes in order to optimize the design and to further improve the Reliability aspects of the system prior to shipment to the customer.The chosen approach ensures an automated; repeatable and reproducible data collection; calculation and visualization of big data sets and connecting them to well-known Reliability Engineering strategies like Reliability Growth Analysis.

To address these automation and long-term health monitoring issues; we have developed a multi-modal platform that employs common; low-cost wearables; and teleconferencing tools that takes advantage of cloud streaming services. One modality is based on Visual IoT and edge devices that automatically connect as teleconferencing clients to record human subjects’ telerehabilitation and teletreatment sessions and push these recordings to cloud storage. We performed experiments applying two different deep learning models to the cloud video streams to track whole-body skeleton motion or to detect hand keypoints during telerehabilitation.

Location intelligence applications aim at exploiting those geo-referenced data in generating visualizations and dashboards that provide deep insights for assisting decision making in smart cities and urban planning. As data arriving are mostly geo-referenced and the rate is fluctuating in pace and skewness; computations upon streams should depend on approximation by applying methods such as sampling. Representativeness in sampling designs remains the pivotal concern in the literature. In spatial data streams contexts; it loosely means selecting proportional counts of spatial tuples from each group of tuples that belong to the same real geometry (i.e.; geographically residing in the same proximity) within each streaming time window. This is challenging in streaming settings because spatial data is parametrized; loosing hence it is real geometries; which requires costly geometric operations to project them back to maps. To close this void; we have designed SpatialSPE in a previous work and incorporated an efficient fine-grained spatial online sampling method (SAOS) transparently within its layers. In this paper; we extend SAOS (the novel method is termed ex-SAOS) by new features that allow efficient online spatial sampling on a coarser level; which is a requirement in smart city scenarios.

Daily mobility analysis is complex and requires simultaneous exploration and combination of different indicators at different spatial and temporal granularity levels. The design of effective geovisualization environments supporting this analysis evokes several challenges due to the diversity and multiplicity of indicators; the granularity of space and time; and time integration.

We analyzed the pilot version with satisfaction through a survey and an interview with health workers from Sidi Said; a local hospital located in Meknès; Morocco; which receives patients suffering from COVID-19. Methods: We have formed a team effort that involves health professionals; specialists from various fields and who participated in the design process of this project. It is a review of the existing literature and interviews with health professionals seeking to trace all the functions of this application. The user interface graphics; whether at the hospital or patient application level; were reviewed for effective usability by a multidisciplinary team. After having had to develop the pilot version of the application; the usefulness and the gratitude of the application were evaluated by eight patients and carers by means of a utility test; based on a real scenario; a utility survey. The objective is to ensure communication between the mobile application and the decision support application at the emergency services level to facilitate the detection of people who had developed COVID-19 as well as follow-up at home for detected patients. Results: The COVID-19 mobile management application provides capture functions and can afford information that helps in the prescription of appropriate drugs to patients at home. It is used to identify people who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19; to carry out a large-scale screening by sending alert messages to these people; and to follow up via geolocation. There is also the possibility via Bluetooth; for the monitoring of patients without the activation of the Geolocation option. The approach adopted aims to reduce congestion in hospitals by identifying people suffering from respiratory illnesses or who may be contaminated; and monitoring them remotely. We offered six functions to achieve the objective of this project. Main: Respiratory crisis journal; medication recall; appointment; survey of people contacted; personal equipment and dashboard; daily traceability and monitoring; and geolocation. We have integrated the application of the electronic healthcare registration system in hospitals. To simplify usability; the frequently used functions; which are relatively important; can be found on the main page under the heading “COVID-19 monitoring” (in French: COVID-19 monitoring); and “Medication log” (in French: Journal medication). In addition; during graphic design; art therapy was used to improve the psychological stability of the patient. Eight participants were employed for the evaluation. For scenario-based tasks; out of ten tasks; all participants can record the entries in detail. The system use scale score was 94 points; indicating that the system was satisfactory for the patients and the staff who tested and manipulated it. Conclusion: This article confirmed that patients were satisfied with the follow-up at home and with the caregivers of the hospital. In addition; this made it possible to accurately record their symptoms and; therefore; facilitated an early detection of COVID-19. This was very useful for analyzing crisis trends; responding to a broader detection; avoiding contamination within the same family and provide effective support for COVID-19 positive patients at home. Through integration with the electronic health record; patient health care information can be used by health care decision-makers to manage treatment plans and support medical interventions. Currently; all patients who have been followed remotely are cured.

The usage of IaaS Service storage for Cloud Computing is being expanding exponential every year. The cloud storages are used by the cloud user due to its economy compared with other storage methods. The replications of files helps user for easy access with high availability which reduces the overall access time of the files; but at the same time it occupies more storage space and result in high storage cost. The cloud user holds multiple times of the storage than what he is actually needed. It is a dire need of system to find unwanted files in the cloud and also optimize the storage space by evaluating through file access frequency.This paper propose Cloud Storage Monitoring (CSM) system; which monitor the IaaS storage usage and analyze the file access patterns by various parameters to identify the frequency of access; size; future access prediction; replication of files in the cloud storage. This allocates a ranking for each file which also predicts future access pattern. This generates a recommendation dashboard to the user who can decide on the operations such as reorganize; delete or archive the files and eliminate duplicate files in the cloud storage which can increase the space for future use. This system is experimented in the CloudSim environment and validate through multiple simulations testing; by using comparison techniques related to file attributes; delta version-hashing; Data de-duplication. The ranking algorithm technique applied on frequency distribution shows that increase in the storage space upto 10.91% higher than the normal system.

In this article we systematically review literature on dashboard implementation in healthcare; where dashboards have been employed widely; and where there is widespread interest for improving the current state of the art; and subsequently analyse approaches taken towards evaluation. We draw upon consolidated dashboard literature and our own observations to introduce a general definition of dashboards which is more relevant to current trends; together with seven evaluation scenarios - task performance; behaviour change; interaction workflow; perceived engagement; potential utility; algorithm performance and system implementation. These scenarios distinguish different evaluation purposes which we illustrate through measurements; example studies; and common challenges in evaluation study design. We provide a breakdown of each evaluation scenario; and highlight some of the more subtle questions. We demonstrate the use of the proposed framework by a design study guided by this framework.
